"C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!",There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!
"Wait, does he eat chalk?","All right Joey, be nice. So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?"
"Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!",
Sounds like a date to me.,"Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex."
"Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.",
"Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.","Oh, yeah. Had that dream."
That's right.,Instead of...?
No.,Never had that dream.
And they weren't looking at you before?!,"All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me."
,"Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!"
"This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.",Hi.
"I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...","Are you okay, sweetie?"
Carol moved her stuff out today.,Cookie?
Let me get you some coffee.,Ohh.
Ooh! Oh!,Thanks.
Fine! Be murky!,"No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?"
No you don't.,"I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy."
And you never knew she was a lesbian...,"No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!"
Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... Did I say that out loud?,"No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?"
"Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., ""I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren."" was what? A wrong number?","I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well."
"Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?",Sorry.
"Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!",
,"I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!"
Rachel?!,And I just want a million dollars!
Can I get you some coffee?,"Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!"
"Hi, sure!","De-caff. Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?"
,Hi.
"Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'. So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.","So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?"
"Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue...",Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
Tuna or egg salad? Decide!,"Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it."
"Daddy, I just... I can't marry him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me!",I'll have whatever Christine is having.
"If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off.",
I say push her down the stairs.,"Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants."
,Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
You can see where he'd have trouble.,"C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!"
"Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...","Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica."
,"Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!"
"Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens, bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with string. These are a few...","Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things..."
I helped!,I'm all better now.
"And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.","Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life. The whole, 'hat' thing."
"What, like there's a rule or something?","Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!"
"Please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound.",
"Oh God, is it 6:30? Buzz him in!","It's, uh, it's Paul."
"Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?",Who's Paul?
He finally asked you out?,Maybe. Joey: Wait. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?
"Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.",Yes!
"Please, no, go, that'd be fine!","Rach, wait, I can cancel..."
That'd be good...,"Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?"
"No, go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy!",Really?
,"What does that mean? Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot?"
Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!,"Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. ... everybody, everybody, this is Paul."
"Okay, umm-umm, I'll just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah...","I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?"
"Change! Okay, sit down. Two seconds.",A wandering?
,"Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good."
Yeah?,"Hey, Paul!"
"Shut up, Joey!","Here's a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red."
"Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!","So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?"
"Yes, and we're very excited about it.","Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture."
"Okay, sure.","Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight. It's been kinda a long day."
"Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.","Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?"
"I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.","Love is sweet as summer showers, love is a wondrous work of art, but your love oh your love, your love...is like a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart. La-la-la-la-la- Thank you. La-la-la-la...ohhh!"
I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.,
What's this?,It's a beautiful thing.
Which goes where?,I would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.
,I have no idea.
All finished!,Done with the bookcase!
"Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here.","This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known."
"Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?","Yes, please don't spoil all this fun."
"Oh, God.",You guys.
Oh my God!,You got screwed.
"I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. I guess I should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I mean, how clean can teeth get?",Oh my God!
"Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her-","My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?"
"That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch.",-leg?
"Ooh, steer clear of you.","You actually broke her watch? Wow! The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel."
"Barry, I'm sorry... I am so sorry... I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju- Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look, look, I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel, but it isn't me, it's not me. And not that I have any idea who me is right now, but you just have to give me a chance too...",That's right.
Shut up!,I'm divorced! I'm only 26 and I'm divorced!
That only took me an hour.,You must stop!
"You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...","Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento. You, however have had the love of a woman for four years. Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it! I don't think that was my point!"
I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.,"What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!"
"Ever since she walked out on me, I, uh...",Stay out of my freezer!
"No, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda revelation.","What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with noodles?"
Isn't there?,"Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?"
"Well, ever-ev-... ever since she left me, um, I haven't been able to, uh, perform. ...Sexually.","Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were you gonna say?"
It's okay...,"Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry..."
Two years.,I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long?
"So you still think you, um... might want that fifth date?",Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!
"We are gathered here today to join Joanne Louise Cunningham and Charles, Chachi-Chachi-Chachi, Arcola in the bound of holy matrimony.","...Yeah. Yeah, I do."
"Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you?",Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's the difference!
"Angela's the screamer, Andrea has cats.","Great story! But, I uh, I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea... Oh man,"
"Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask?",Right. Thanks. It's June. I'm outta here.
"Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life.",
Congratulations.,That is amazing.
"If can invade Poland, there isn't anything I can't do.","Y'know, I figure if I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do."
"Oh good, Lenny and Squigy are here.","Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something... Although actually I'm really not that hungry..."
Morning.,Morning. Good morning.
"Hello, Paul.","Morning, Paul."
,"Hi, Paul, is it?"
Stop!,Thank you! Thank you so much!
We'll talk later.,"No, I'm telling you last night was like umm, all my birthdays, both graduations, plus the barn raising scene in Witness."
That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real date?,Yeah. Thank you.
Okayyy!,"Shut up, and put my table back."
"So, like, you guys all have jobs?","All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference..."
"Yeah, I'm an actor.","Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we buy stuff."
I doubt it. Mostly regional work.,Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?
"Look, it was a job all right?","Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the park."
I will not take this abuse.,"'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'"
"You should both know, that he's a dead man. Oh, Chandler?","You're right, I'm sorry. ""Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..."""
I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.,So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.
"Oh, yeah.","I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco?"
Oh wow. Are you in trouble.,"Well, it's like that. With feelings."
Want a wedding dress? Hardly used.,Big time!
"Oh, look, wish me luck!","I think we are getting a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work."
I'm gonna go get one of those job things.,What for?
"Hey, Monica!",
"You had sex, didn't you?","Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida?"
"Oh, I hate you, I'm pushing my Aunt Roz through Parrot Jungle and you're having sex! So? Who?",How do you do that?
"Paul the Wine Guy? Oh yeah, I know Paul.",You know Paul?
"Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul. Y'know before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years.",You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?
"Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?",Of course it was a line!
I hate men! I hate men!,I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.
Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?,"Oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe."
"I just thought he was nice, y'know?","All right, c'mere, gimme your feet."
,I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!
You got a job?,Guess what?
And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.,Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.
"Oh, how well you know me...","You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!"
How'd you pay for them?,"They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!"
And who pays for that?,"Uh, credit card."
"Oh God, come on you guys, is this really necessary? I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want.",Um... my... father.
I know that. That's why I was getting married.,"C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life."
Thank you.,"Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time."
,"You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel."
"All right, you ready?",The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'...
"You can, I know you can!","No. No, no, I'm not ready! How can I be ready? ""Hey, Rach! You ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?"" Come on, I can't do this!"
"Come on, you made coffee! You can do anything!",I don't think so.
"Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut...","C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,..."
Rachel! That was a library card!,Y'know what? I think we can just leave it at that. It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...
"Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.","Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut.."
Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're gonna love it!,
"Well, that's it You gonna crash on the couch?",
You be okay?,"No. No, I gotta go home sometime."
"Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor. What?",Yeah.
Goodnight.,"That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody."
"Mmm. Oh, no-",
"No no no, go-",Sorry-
Split it?,"No, you have it, really, I don't want it-"
"Okay. You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.",Okay.
You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.,I knew.
"Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?",I did.
"Okay... okay, maybe I will...","Yeah, maybe..."
Goodnight.,Goodnight.
"See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you?",
I can't believe what I'm hearing here.,I just grabbed a spoon.
What? I-I said you had a-,I can't believe what I'm hearing here...
Would you stop?,What I said you had...
Yes!,"Oh, was I doing it again?"
"Oh, you wouldn't know a great butt if it came up and bit ya.","I said that you had a nice butt, it's just not a great butt."
Would anybody like more coffee?,There's an image.
I'm just serving it.,"Did you make it, or are you just serving it?"
"Kids, new dream... I'm in Las Vegas.","Yeah. Yeah, I'll have a cup of coffee."
"Ugh. Excuse me, could you give this to that guy over there? Go ahead. Thank you. Sorry. Okay, Las Vegas.","Ahh, miss? More coffee?"
"What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.","Okay, so, I'm in Las Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli-"
"Oh, yeah!","Yeah, right!.......Y'serious?"
Absolutely.,Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.
"Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket.","Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out."
"Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.","The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake."
"No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry?",....Are we still talking about sex?
Does she.,"Well, she has issues."
"Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See?","He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet!"
,"Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife?"
"Yes, it is. Carol! Hi!",No. No.
,"Okay, okay, yes, it is. How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age."
So.,Hi.
Sorry. You look good too.,"You look great. I, uh... I hate that."
A lesbian?,"Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh..."
"Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh-","Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family?"
I'm pregnant.,"Why- why are you here, Carol?"
"Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.",Pregnant?!
Are you through with that?,...Then I've already seen this one!
Whose little ball of paper is this?!,"Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down."
,"Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... ...now I wish I was dead."
"Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.","She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- -but, it's fine!"
"Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way.","Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow."
"That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.","Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come."
What?,"Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!"
Eeaagh!,Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!
Has anybody seen my engagement ring?,
"Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God....","Yeah, it's beautiful."
"Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder...","No, look, don't touch that!"
Oh! Yeah!,"Easy Rach, we'll find it. Won't we!"
Doy! Probably right before she lost it!,"Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?"
"I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...",You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...
"Ohhhhh, don't be mad...",...Dinah?
"Oh, I am sorry...",You didn't.
"Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!",I gave you one job!
I just... can't do it.,"Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne..."
,Boys? We're going in.
Wow. That is not a happy hi.,.....Hi.
Ooh! I found it!,Carol's pregnant.
"Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now.",W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...
"Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?","Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?"
She is so great! I miss her.,"Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me."
"I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.",What does she mean by 'involved'?
So what are you gonna do?,"Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow."
,"I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father."
"Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. Mmm! What's that curry taste?",".....Well, this is still ruined, right?"
Mmmm!,Curry.
"Do you remember the Ludwins? The big one had a thing for you, didn't she?","I- I think they're great! I, I really do."
"Aw, Mom...",They all had a thing for him.
"Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant-","I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?"
"Well, they don't have to know that...","No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant."
Yeah.,"Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?"
"I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.","Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy."
"What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.",
"Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...",I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!
Nothing! It's an expression.,What's that supposed to mean?
"Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...",No it's not.
"Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.",
"...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem.",
"Okay! Okay. Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.","So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?"
And you knew about this?!,
"Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done.","Your folks are really that bad, huh?"
Must pee.,"Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- -I'd want yours."
You're twins?,"Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins."
What does she do?,"Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type."
"All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now.",She's a waitress.
"Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.","Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this."
,"The lights, please.."
I'm just cleaning up.,...How long was I in there?
"Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks!",D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help?
Oh.. a little..,"Anyway.. um.. So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow?"
A lot.,Mm-hmm..
"So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped?",Mm.
"Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?","Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN..."
Remember when we were in high school together?,Got me.
"I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? ..Ross?",Yeah.
"Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here..","Yes, yes!"
"Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway.",Me either...
Hi.,
How could I forget?,"Ross, you remember Susan."
"Hello, Susan. Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...?",Ross.
..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he-,Dr. Oberman.
"-she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation?",She.
"Okay, that's great. No, I'm- Oh.","Yes, and she's very supportive."
"Quack, quack..",Thanks.
Barry?,Ross? That opens my cervix.
Are you sure?,C'mon in.
Huh?!,"Yeah! It's fine, it's fine. Robbie's gonna be here for hours."
I'm- uh- I'm okay... You look great!,"So, how ya doin?"
"Dr. Farber, Jason Greenstein's gagging.","Yeah, well.."
,Be right there. Be back in a sec.
Okay.,I dumped him.
Give me a 'for instance'.,"So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made?"
Marlon-,"Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name?"
"-if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl.",Marlon?!
As in my grandmother.,...As in Mouse?
Julia..,"Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia?"
"'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..?",We agreed on Minnie.
"Oh, not much. I-I got a job.",Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to?
Why are- why are you so tanned?,"Oh, that's great."
Oh no. You went on our honeymoon alone?,"Oh, I, uh- I went to Aruba."
Me?!,"No. I went with, uh.. Now, this may hurt."
"Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?!",No! I went with Mindy.
"Oh! Well, um.. You've got plugs!","Yeah, well, uh, we're kind of a thing now."
And you've got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye!,Careful! They haven't quite taken yet.
Okay..,"Not for her. Listen, I really wanted to thank you."
Wow.,"See, about a month ago, I wanted to hurt you. More than I've ever wanted to hurt anyone in my life. And I'm an orthodontist."
What?,"You know, you were right? I mean, I thought we were happy. We weren't happy. But with Mindy, now I'm happy. Spit."
"Anyway, um, I guess this belongs to you. And thank you for giving it to me.",Me.
,"Well, thank you for giving it back."
"Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen?",Hello?!
Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller.,Helen Geller? I don't think so.
"No, I mean it's not Geller.",Thank you!
"No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch.","What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?"
It's my baby too.,"Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title?"
"Yeah, and we all know what a challenge that is!","Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm."
"No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too.","All right, you two, stop it!"
"Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch.",Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse.
"My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do-","Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way!"
Yeah. Yeah. A little.,Knock knock!How are we today? Any nausea?
"You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now.","Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. Uh, lie back.."
Oh my God.,
I know.,Look at that.
What are we supposed to be seeing here?,Well? Isn't that amazing?
"You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato.","I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise."
Okay!,"Then don't do that, alright?"
Mm-hmm.,Monica. Whaddya think?
No.,Wh- are you welling up?
Am not!,"You are, you're welling up."
Oh shut up!,You're gonna be an aunt.
Hi guys!,"Hi, Mindy. Hi, it-it's Rachel. Yeah, I'm fine. I-I saw Barry today. Oh, yeah, yeah he-he told me. No, no, it's okay. I hope you two are very happy, I really do. Oh, oh, and Mind, y'know, if-if everything works out, and you guys end up getting married and having kids- and everything- I just hope they have his old hairline and your old nose. Okay, I know it was a cheap shot, but I feel so much better now."
"Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go?","Hey, Pheebs! Hi!"
Ohh. Ouch.,"Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again!'"
"Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'.","What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?"
"Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'.",Since when?
"Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'.",Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.
Yeah. Cushions the blow.,And everybody knows this?
"That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.","Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm."
"What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi!","Uh, Ross."
"""Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die.""","""So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?"""
Thanks! Let's keep going.,"Hey, that was really good!"
"""I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can smoke.""","Okay. ""So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?"""
,"""Smoke away."""
What?,I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.
,Relax your hand!
Whoah!,Not so much!
Hey!,Hey!
,"Alright, now try taking a puff."
"No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.",Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.
,"It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here."
Y'miss it?,"Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete."
"No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.","Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. Oh.. my.. God."
That's ridiculous!,
"Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me! Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an iced tea. I'm getting pretty good at this!",Can I use.. either thumb?
Good for me!,"Yeah. Yeah, excellent."
"Y'okay, Phoebe?",
What did they do to you?,"Yeah- no- I'm just- it's, I haven't worked- It's my bank."
Easy.,"It's nothing, it's just- Okay. I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT-"
"Oh, Satan's minions at work again...",- and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account.
What are you talking about? Keep it!,"Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them."
"Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!","It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be like stealing."
We're with you. We got it.,"Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping- 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine'..."
Okay. I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this giant karmic debt.,
Hey. Whaddya doing?,"Chandler, what are you doing?"
"Oh! Oh, God!",
"I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking.",What is this?!
And this- is my reward!,"Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years!"
"Okay, so this time I won't quit!","Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit."
"All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out.",Ohhh! Put it out!
"Alright. I'm gonna go change, I've got a date.","Oh, no! I- I can't drink this now!"
"'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having fun.",This Alan again? How's it goin'?
"Let's see, today's Monday... Never.",So when do we get to meet the guy?
No. Not after what happened with Steve.,"Oh, come on! Come on!"
"Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out.",What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.
Nope. Schhorry.,"Well, then can we meet him?"
"Listen. As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing. I mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you.","I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd."
"Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy..","I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked."
"Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi.","Let it go, Ross."
Yeah! We promise! We'll be good!,Do you all promise?
,Chandler? Do you promise to be good?
,"You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!"
"Hey, Pheebs.",
What bank is this?,"'Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our error. We have credited your account with five hundred dollars. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you'll accept this- -football phone as our free gift.' Do you believe this?! Now I have a thousand dollars, and a football phone!"
Hey. It's him. Who is it?,
Chandler! He's here!,It's Alan.
"Okay, please be good, please. Just remember how much you all like me.",
"Hi. Alan, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Alan.",
"Hi, Alan.",Hi.
,I've heard schho much about all you guyschh!
"Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow. Okay. Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin. Who's gonna take the first shot, hmm?",
C'mon!,
Loved him! Yeah! He's great!,"...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, I can't do this, can't do this. We loved him."
Yeah!,Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?
Yeah.,And did you notice...?
"Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe!",Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked.
"From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...'",...What shoe?
...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured.,
Really!,"What future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be, y'know, it."
"You know what I like most about him, though?","Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhoff impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right?"
The way he makes me feel about myself.,What?
Hi.. how was the game?,Yeah...
WE WON!! Thank you! Yes!,Well..
Alan.,Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?
"I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.","He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-..."
Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..,"Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball.."
"..I dunno, a little too Alan?",What?
"Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore.","Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan."
"Hey, Lizzie.",I personally could have a gallon of Alan.
I brought you alphabet soup.,"Hey, Weird Girl."
"Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, y'know, ""sometimes y"". Uh, I also have something else for you.",Did you pick out the vowels?
"No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?",Saltines?
I know.,"What? Oh my God, there's really money in here."
"No, I want you to have it. I don't want it.","Weird Girl, what are you doing?"
"Oh, that's fine, no.","No, no, I ha-I have to give you something."
"No. 'Cause you need that. No, it's okay, thanks.",Would you like my tin-foil hat?
"Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. Okay?","Please, let me do something."
Okay.,Okay.
"No, I'm fine.",Keep the change. Sure you don't wanna pretzel?
,See ya.
A thumb?!,Huh!
Eww!,
"Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?","I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker!"
Nooo!,"Does, um, anyone wanna see?"
"Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!",
"Hey, this is so unfair!",It's worse than the thumb!
"So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?","Oh, why is it unfair?"
...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?,
"Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?","Well, I-I could live without it."
"Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.",
,"Oh, ""you do, do you""?"
"""Indeed there isn't""... I should really get back to work.","You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly."
"Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.","Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered."
Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?,
"Okay.. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like.",No.
"Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel the thing. I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing.","Waitwait.. we talking about the coyotes here? All right, a cow got through!"
I know.. it's gonna be really hard.,"Honey.. you should always feel the thing. Listen, if that's how you feel about the guy, Monica, dump him!"
"No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about.","Well, he's a big boy, he'll get over it."
Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?,Do you have any respect for your body?
"Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you.","Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it."
"God, he's good.","Really? He does? Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. Well, okay, thanks!"
Yeah.,If only he were a woman.
"Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too.",
Hey. Where's Joey?,Okay. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch.
I think he's across the hall.,"Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong?"
There y'go.,Thanks.
"Hey Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that Pop-Tart?.. Pheebs?","Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now."
"Hey, I might!",Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart?
You're kidding. Oh my God.,"Sorry. ..Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb."
What's going on?,"And on my way over here, I stepped in gum. ...What is up with the universe?!"
Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear..,Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together.
"Oh, God!","Uh, Joey.."
Oh! That was Lambchop!,Okay..
"Wait, wait, I'm getting a deja vu...no, I'm not.","Please, guys, we have to talk."
There it is!,"Alright, we have to talk."
,"Okay. It's-it's about Alan. There's something that you should know. I mean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.. I've decided to break up with Alan."
"No, nononono.. it's just.. things change. People change.",Is there somebody else?
So that's it? It's over? Just like that?,We didn't change..
"Look, I- I could go on pretending-","You know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care about someone, and I just- I-"
"-but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan- It wouldn't be fair to you!",Okay!
I'm sorry..,"Who-who wants fair? Y'know, I just want things back. Y'know, the way they were."
"I just can't believe this! I mean, with the holidays coming up- I wanted him to meet my family-","Oh, she's sorry! I feel better!"
"Oh, yeah! Right!",I'll meet somone else. There'll be other Alans.
"Hey hey, we'll be fine. We're just gonna need a little time.",Are you guys gonna be okay?
Wow.,I understand.
"Yeah, I'm sorry too. But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved.","I'm, I'm really sorry."
"Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can't stand your friends.",Relieved?
Yeah. He could row like a viking.,Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun.
Mmm.,Hi.
"Oh, y'know..",So how'd it go?
He said he's really gonna miss you guys.,Did he mention us?
...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.,"You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere."
"I don't care, I don't care! Game's over! I'm weak! I've gotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke!",No no no!
"Yeah, alright.",If you never smoke again I'll give you seven thousand dollars!
"Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And bigger boobs!",Alright. Phoebe?
"Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd.. make myself omnipotent forever.","Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what about you?"
"Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy.","See, there's always one guy. ""If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes."""
Probably kill myself!,"Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?"
"Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live!",..Excuse me?
"You are? Ross, I'm sorry..","Joey, uh- OMnipotent."
I cannot sleep in a public place.,How does she do that?
Oh! What what what! ...Hi.,Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.
What's going on with you?,"It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again."
Why?,I got no sleep last night!
"Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight.","My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they're both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they're constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they're having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are!"
,Thanks.
You got waaaay too much free time.,"...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See, I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here."
"Happy birthday, pal!","Hey! Here's the birthday boy! Ross, check it out: hockey tickets, Rangers-Penguins, tonight at the Garden, and we're taking you."
"Funny, my birthday was seven months ago.","We love you, man."
"So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date?",So?
"Oh my God, oh- is today the twentieth, October twentieth?","Well, aren't we Mr. ""The glass is half empty."""
Ohhh.,"Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't remember."
Eleven days before Halloween.. all the good costumes are gone?,What's wrong with the twentieth?
"The hell with hockey, let's all do that!","Today's the day Carol and I first.. consummated our physical relationship. Sex. ..You know what, I-I'd better pass on the game. I think I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover."
What are you doing?,"C'mon, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy, Huh? Huh? Huh?"
"C'mon, Ross!",I have no idea.
You got it.,"Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger?"
"Look-look-look-look-look, my first pay check! Look at the window, there's my name! Hi, me!",
"Wow, you worked in a mine?","I remember the day I got my first pay check. There was a cave in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed."
"God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. I wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally not worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what- Chandler, look at that.","I worked in a Dairy Queen, why?"
"Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job.","Oh, this is not that bad."
"Yeah, yeah.","You can totally, totally live on this."
Oh! Yeah!,"Oh, by the way, great service tonight."
Hockey! Hockey! Hockey.,
Oh my God!,Rachel?
What are you guys doing here?,I swear I've seen birds do this on Wild Kingdom.
Look at you in the apron. You look like you're in a play.,"Well, we were in the city shopping, and your mom said you work here, aaand it's true!"
I know. I know! I'm a duplex.,"Look at you, you are so big I can't believe it!"
"Well, guess who my dad's making partner in his firm?",So what's going on with you?
"Look, look, I have elbows!",And while we're on the subject of news..
Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there's the pass!,...Poulet passes it up to Leetch!
"Carol was wearing boots just like those the night that we- we first- y'know. Fact, she, uh- she never took'em off, 'cause we-we- Sorry. Sorry.",We'll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women's shoes.
What?,
"Yes, Bunny?",Peach pit.
-Peaches?,"Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-"
Could've been a peach.,"Actually, nectarines, but basically..."
"Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's! What? Thought we were trying to find stuff.","Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I walked her to the- -the bus stop... I'm fine."
"Well, the biggest news is still you dumping Barry at the altar!","So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt!"
Okay.,Alright. Let's talk reality for a second.
"What? Guys, I'm not.",When are you coming home?
I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've got this job-,"C'mon, this is us."
"Okay, I'm not just waitressing. I'm.. I, um... I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh... I take the uh dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies.",Waitressing?
"Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends? Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch?",Well. Your mom didn't tell us about the blobbies.
"Weeeell, it's rum, and-",What's that?
"We thought since Phoebe was staying over tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got cookie dough, we got Twister...",Okay.
"Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card people.","Ooh! Ooh! And I brought Operation! But, um, I lost the tweezers, so we can't operate. But we can prep the guy!"
"Could you please tell me what this is in reference to? Yes, hold on. Um, they say there's been some unusual activity on your account.","Oh, God, ask them what they want."
"That is the unusual activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay.",But I haven't used my card in weeks!
"Uh- Rachel has left the building, can you call back?","They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay.. they wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see. Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money, everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and I'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then you can tell them I'm okay, okay?"
"Sorry, sorry... Uh-oh.","Alright, c'mon! Let's play Twister!"
"No, actually I was just saying it looks like we're not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that night... It was the first frost...",What? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?
You should feel great about yourself! You're doing this amazing independence thing!,"C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit."
You are just like Jack.,"Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like, everything. And for what?"
"No, Jack and the Beanstalk.",...Jack from downstairs?
"Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you live in the Village..","Ah, the other Jack."
"Oh, see, Jack did love the cow.","Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow, I gave up an orthodontist. Okay, I-I-I know, I know I didn't love him-"
Floopy?,"But see, it was a plan. Y'know, it was clear. It was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like..."
"So what, you're not the only one. I mean, half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it's all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy.",Yeah.
"Okay, but Monica, what if- what if it doesn't come together?","Oh, like that's a word."
"Oh, well... 'cause.... you just... I don't like this question.",...Pheebs?
"Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not laughing now, are ya pal!","Okay, see, see, you guys, what if we don't get magic beans? I mean, what if all we've got are.. beans?"
Pass it! Pass it!,"See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks."
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!,He's open!
"Hey, look, we're on that TV thing!",
'Scuse me.,
"Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room.","It says to call this number if you're not completely satisfied with this candy bar. Well, I'm not completely satisfied."
"Look, I don't wanna make any trouble, okay, but I'm in a lot of pain here, alright? My face is dented.","Hold on. Fill these out, sit over there."
"Well, how long do you think it'll be?","Well, you'll have to wait your turn."
"Hey, this- Heyy...",Any minute now.
"No, you were right. I don't have a plan.","I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to bring you down."
Thank God. Food.,Pizza guy!
What?,Phoebe?
I don't even have a 'pl'.,Do you have a plan?
"No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese.","Hi, one, uh, mushroom, green pepper and onion?"
Wait! Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?',"Wait, you're not 'G.Stephanopoulos?' Man, my dad's gonna kill me!"
"Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks?","Yeah. This one goes across the street, I must have given him yours. Oh, bonehead, bonehead!"
Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?,"Yeah, that sounds about right."
"No, pretty much just a towel.",And-and a power tie?
So you guys want me to take this back?,Oh God.
"Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus?",Are you nuts?! We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza!
I see pizza!,Big Bird's friend.
Hello? Who are we spying on?,"Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see!"
"Oh, him, the little guy? Oh, I love him!","White House adviser? Clinton's campaign guy? The one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt?"
Please tell me it's his mother.,"Ooh, wait.. wait, I see a woman."
"Oh, no...",Definitely not his mother.
"Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean, that guy with the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with? Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad... I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other. Y'know, I feel like I've lost her.. Ba-!","Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor.. she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza- Hey, that's not for you, bitch!"
Yeah.,Light still out?
"Oh please, they're having sex.",Oh. Maybe they're- napping.
"So, whaddya think George is like?",Shut up!
Yeah?,I think he's shy.
I remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow.,Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal.
"He's right, enough, already. What is the big deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her for seven years after that.","Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?"
"Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?","Look, it's just a little more complicated..."
Then what?,"Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you..."
What?,My first time with Carol was...
With Carol? Oh.,It was my first time.
"Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight!","So in your whole life, you've only been with one oh."
Uh-huh.,"Okay. Okay, I got one. Do you remember that vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much?"
"Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay, fine, fine. Now I don't feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley.","Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha haaaah!"
You'd already broken up.,What?! You slept with Jason?
A couple hours.,How long?
"Okay, okay, okay, I got one! Anyway- The valentine Tommy Rollerson left in your locker was really from me.","Oh, that's nice!"
Hello? Like he was really gonna send you one? She was a big girl.,Excuse me?!
I was laughing! You made me laugh!,"Really. Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee in their pants in seventh grade!"
Where?,There he is! There he is!
He is so cute!,Right- where we've been looking all night!
"Yeah, drop it! Drop the towel! Please drop the wowww.","Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!"
"I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic...",Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with one woman?
"No, you kidding? The guy's a freak..",Really?
Hi.,"Hey, buddy."
"Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight.","Oh, that's attractive."
"Oh, ah- the kid has it.","Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? Where's my puck?"
"I found it. Finders keepers, losers weepers.","The kid...? Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck."
"Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatever can't do it. Listen, uh- gimme back my puck.","You gotta do it, man."
"'Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme!",No.
Hey! Hey! No rough holding in my ER!,No! No!
...Now that was fun.,GIVE ME MY PUCK!!
"Could've played Monopoly, but nooooo.","Okay, Monica: Right foot red."
Thanks.,
,"Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue. Good."
"Oh, okay. Will you take my place?","Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the Visa card people."
"Nooo! Hello? Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't been using it much. Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really.","Alright. Yes, this is Rachel."
I've got magic beans. Never-never mind.,Green. To the green.
Ohhh... I'm fine.,"To the left, to the left- aww!"
"Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?",Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.
"We can? All right, I'm tryin' that.",Come on! You guys can pee standing up.
"Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care.","Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me."
Multiple orgasms!,
"No plans, huh?","So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night, Sat-ur-day night!"
"Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?",Not a one.
"Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it.","Oh, right, right, shut up."
"Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling.","No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note."
"Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.","You know, if you want, I'll do it with you."
Tony?,"No, I mean you break up with Janice and I'll break up with Tony."
"Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? I don't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I don't know.","Oh, you're breaking up with Tony?"
"Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing. Nothing, just, just, I'm fine.",Does anybody want anything else?
It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.,What's the matter? Why so scrunchy?
"Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He called me young lady.","That guy, he burns me up."
"Did he give you that whole ""You're-not-up-to-this"" thing again?","Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that."
"Uh-huh, uh-huh.","Oh, yeah, yeah. Actually, I got the extended disco version, with three choruses of ""You'll never make it on your own""."
"Hi, Joey.",
,"My god, Angela."
Are you gonna go over there?,"Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her."
Joey.,"No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool. Hey, Angela."
That's because I'm wearing a dress that accents my boobs.,You look good.
,You don't say.
"Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama.","So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?"
Who?,"Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry there too?"
Don't you have a laundry room in your building?,"Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join you both, here?"
Sure.,"Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but they're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?"
Forget it Joey. I'm with Bob now.,
"Bob is great. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. You, you go on three auditions a month and you call yourself an actor, but Bob...",Bob? Who the hell's Bob?
"Yeah, well, sorry, Joe. You said let's just be friends, so guess what?","Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too."
We're just friends.,What?
What four of us?,"Fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner together tonight? You know, as friends?"
"Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you.","You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica."
"Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is...",Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.
What?,"Oh, god help us."
"Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.",Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!
"I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?",What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.
"Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?","Ok, bye. Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel."
"It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.",It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.
Yuh-huh.,Nuh-uh.
"Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwearyou want it to be dirty?","So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?"
"Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?",No.
There you go.,"Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What, it says I'm a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick something else up on the way."
Yep.,Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?
Which what?,Which?
"No, but he's...","You've never met Bob, have you?"
,"Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly..."
...horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now.,"Hey, Joey."
This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.,Where are they? Where are they?
"Eww, I don't wanna do that.",It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.
Here we go.,
"Hey, Janice.","Ok, have a good break-up."
"Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please?","Oh, my god, I am so glad you called me. I had the most supremely awful day."
,"We got the proofs back from that photo shoot, you know, the one with the little vegetables. Anyway, they pretty much sucked, so, I blew off the rest of the day, and I went shopping... ... and I got you, I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm looking, I got you..."
What?,What?
I got you...these.,What... did you get me there?
"Well, I knew you had the Rockys, and so I figured, you know, you can wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle, or you can wear Rocky and Rocky,or, you can mix and match, moose and squirrel. Whatever you want.",Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.
,That's great.
"No, no, I'm still working on mine.","Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?"
That's it?,
"Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.","Yeah, it was really hard."
"Comin' through. Move, move.","Ok, you weren't there."
"Yeah, well, now you're kinda not.","Oh, 'scuse me. I was kinda using that machine."
"Oh, I'm sorry, is that your basket? It's really pretty. Unfortunately, I don't see suds.",But I saved it. I put my basket on top.
"No suds, no save. Ok?",What?
What's goin' on?,
Was your basket on top?,"Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine."
So?,"Yeah, but, there were no suds."
"No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second. That's my friend's machine.","Well, you know, no suds, no save."
"Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it.","Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it."
"All right, show's over. Nothing to see here. Ok, let's do laundry.",
"Well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle, uh...Do you, uh, do you...Oh, hey, uh you must need detergent.",That was amazing. I can't even send back soup.
What's that?,
,"Uberveiss. It's new, it's German, it's extra-tough."
"Oh god. Oh, am I being like a total laundry spaz? I mean, am I supposed to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants?","Rach, do you uh, are you gonna separate those?"
"Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me. I'm a laundry virgin.","Rach, have you never done this before?"
"Ok, Well, what about these are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates?","Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things."
"He is so cute. So, where did you guys grow up?","Uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call."
Cleveland.,Brooklyn Heights.
Oh my god.,"How, how did that happen?"
I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I'm not.,What?
Yep. Pretty much.,"So, you and Angela, huh?"
"Huh, I never really noticed.","You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute nibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel."
"Monica, Monica is great.","Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it."
"I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.","Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually."
"It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight.","Yeah, isn't he?"
Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.,You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed.
"Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.",Huh. That's nice.
"Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.",
"Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do.","All right. Well, there you go. Stop it, stop it, stop it."
What uh-oh?,"That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me? I'm sorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross... Uh-oh."
"Ross, what's the matter?","Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done. It's, uh, it's a song. The laundry song that we sing. Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh."
"Come on, show me.","Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done."
"Oh, everything's pink.","All right, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in with all your whites, and now, everything's kinda pink."
"Except it didn't. It happened to me. Oh, god, I'm gonna look like a big marshmallow peep. What am I doing? What am I doing? My father's right. I can't live on my own! I can't even do laundry!","Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, please don't be upset, it could happen to anyone."
"Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?",
Oh my god.,
Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.,What?
Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.,"Come on, they're close."
"Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it'snot really true, is it?","Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross."
"Oh my god, what were you thinking?","Well, who's to say what's true? I mean..."
Oh!,"All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little."
I'm outta here.,Ow!
Really?,"Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you."
,"Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up."
,"I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this, but I couldn't stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story."
"Here's the thing, Janice. You know, I mean, it's like we're different. I'm like the bing, bing, bing. You're like the boom, boom, ... boom.","Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here."
"Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?",Ow!
,"Ow. Um, it's just my lens. It's just my lens. I'll be right back."
Oh my god. How many of those have you had?,I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.
"Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la.","Oh, I don't know, a million?"
All right.,I'm fine.
I'm not fine. Here she comes.,
,Wait here. Breathe.
It's like a gift.,How do you do that?
"Oh, I'd like that.",We should always always break up together.
"Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.",You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.
"Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.",
,"Yeah, well, I had a 24-inch waist. You lose things. Now come on, get outta my way."
"Hey, hey, hey there aren't any clothes in it.","I'm sorry, you know, maybe I wasn't being clear. Uh, this is our cart."
Let go!,"Hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules!"
"All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it!",
Yes! Did you see that?,
I could not have done this without you.,"You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen."
"Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? I'm fine, I'm fine.",
No.,Are you sure?
Yeah.,"Oh, are you sure you're ok?"
Yeah.,Does it still hurt?
,What a neat idea. All your clothes match. I'm gonna do this.
"Hey, how'd it go?",Hi.
"We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves.",Excellent.
"Oh, I'm sorry.","What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way."
"Oh, he needed some time to grieve.",Where's Chandler?
I'm free! I'm free!,
"Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look, there's Joey's picture! This is so exciting!",That oughta do it.
"The exclamation point in the title scares me. Y'know, it's not just Freud, it's Freud!","You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before. Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom..."
"Oh, shhh, shh. Magic is about to happen.",
"Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear.",
God. I feel violated.,"All you want is a dingle, What you envy's a schwang, A thing through which you can tinkle, Or play with, or simply let hang..."
"Ross, ten o'clock.","Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?"
"No, ten o'clock.",Is it? Feels like two.
"There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!",What?
"She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!",Oh. Hel-lo!
"Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'","Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone."
"Oh please, could she be more out of my league? Ross, back me up here.","Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!"
"Thank you, buddy.",He could never get a woman like that in a million years.
You could do that!,"Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys."
Yeah!,Y'think?
C'mon! C'mon!,"Oh God, I can't believe I'm even considering this... I'm very very aware of my tongue..."
...Yes?,Here goes.
"Yes, you said that.","Hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... Chandler! Chandler is my name, and, uh... ...hi."
Chandler?,"Yes, yes I did, but what I didn't say was what I was about to say, what I wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou, goodnight."
Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!,
,Whadja think?
"C'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad. It was better than that thing I did with the trolls, at least you got to see my head.",...Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
"She said yes!! She said yes!! Awful play, man. Whoah. Her name's Aurora, and she's Italian, and she pronounces my name 'Chand-lrr'. 'Chand-lrr'. I think I like it better that way. Oh, listen, the usher gave me this to give to you.",Saw your head. Saw your head.
"The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency. Wow, an agency left me its card! Maybe they wanna sign me!",What is it?
"Hey, kids.",Based on this play? ...Based on this play!
"No, 'cause this line is passion, and this is... just a line.",Hey.
"Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?","Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went."
,It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...
"Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it.","...Luckily none of the bullets hit the engine block. So, we made it to the border, but just barely, and I- ...I've been talking about myself all night long, I'm sorry. What about you? Tell me one of your stories."
...All of a sudden we realised we were in Yammon.,We talked 'til like two. It was this perfect evening... more or less.
'We' would be me and Rick.,"Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?"
Who's Rick?,Who's Rick?
Ooooohhh.,My husband.
No.,"Oh, so you're divorced?"
"No, I'm still married.","Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed?...Hopefully?"
"Don't worry. I imagine he'd be okay with you because really, he's okay with Ethan.","So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?"
Mmmm... Ethan is my... boyfriend.,"Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan?"
"So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?",What?!
...Hm.,I suppose mainly sexual.
What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?,Oh. I'm sorry it didn't work out.
"Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!","Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this?"
"No, of course not! ...Yeah, yeah, it is.","Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?"
I couldn't do it.,What? So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out with someone else?
"When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with more people than she is.","Good for you, Joey."
,"Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-"
"We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!","Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know."
"Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-",Yeah! C'mon!
Tah-daaah!,
"Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors... I even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don't know what that's for.",Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.
"Well, whaddya think?","Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask."
...Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman.,Very clean! It looks great! Terrific!
How-how did that happen?,Uh-oh...
"Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? Just for fun, let's see what it looked like in the old spot. Alright, just to compare. Let's see. Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while.","I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table."
"Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out.",I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.
"Yeah, you are, Monica. Remember when I lived with you? You were like, a little, y'know, Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!","You guys, I am not that bad!"
"Oh c'mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy!",That is so unfair!
"Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away.","Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised. But hey, I can be a kook."
Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice.,Why not?
"Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.",I could do that.
"Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...",Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.
Monica? You're Mom.,STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?
Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!,
"Uh huh.. uh huh... oh my God! Okay! Okay, I'll be there! That was my agent. My agent has just gotten me a job...in the new Al Pacino movie!",
"Well, what's the part?",Oh my God! Whoah!
"Seriously, what-what's the part?","Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy's the reason I became an actor! ""I'm out of order? Pfeeeh. You're out of order! This whole courtroom's out of order!"""
"C'mon, seriously, Joey, what's the part?","""Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!"""
"..You're, you're 'mah mah mah' what?",...I'm his
Oh my God.,"...I'm his butt double. 'Kay? I play Al Pacino's butt. Alright? He goes into the shower, and then- I'm his butt."
"Oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness.","C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big!"
"You're right, you're right, it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?","Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!"
,"Alright, alright, alright..."
For what?,Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.
"Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there.",Whaddya think? Today's the big day!
,Thank you!
He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!,Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.
I warned you...,"C'mon, we're roommates! My eyes!! My eyes!!"
Who is being loud?,
"Oh, you got the whole night, huh?","Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast."
"Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?","Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know.."
"Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that.","No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?"
"...Dammit, hire the girl! Okay, everybody ready?",
Lose the robe.,"Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity."
That would work.,Me?
"Okay, everybody, we'd like to get this in one take, please. Let's roll it.. water's working .. and... action.",Right. Okay. Losing the robe. And the robe is lost.
"And cut. Hey, Butt Guy, what the hell are you doing?",
"No, that was clenching.","Well, I'm- I'm showering."
"I think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch. Once again, rolling... water working... and action....and cut. What was that?","Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? I mean, his wife's dead, his brother's missing... I think his butt would be angry here."
"God, I love these fingers...",I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask...
"No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em, look at how happy they are.",Thank you.
"Oh no nonononononnononono, don't go..","Oh my God, I'm late."
Don't go.,Okay.
"Too bad, she's leaving.","Okay. Oh no, I have to."
"Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick.",I'm sorry. He'll be waiting for me.
"What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!",It's not Rick.
"I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?","No, it's-it's Andrew."
"Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?",He's... new.
"Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us.","No, that's not exactly what I was.."
You.,So what do you want?
"Nono, just you.",You have me!
Lose the other guys.,Whaddyou mean?
"C'mon, we're great together, why not?","...Like, ...all of them?"
"...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!'","Why can't we just have what we have now? Why can't we just talk, and laugh, and make love, without feeling obligated to one another... and up until tonight I thought that's what you wanted too."
"I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish...",So... which one of the two guys will you listen to?
...The second guy.,Which one?
,"Well, call me if you change your mind."
,"Sorry, the first guy runs the lips."
,"Look at it this way: you dumped her. Right? I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy, and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable... Tell me why you did this again?"
"Hey, waitwait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?",Hey!
"No? What happened, big guy?",Nope.
It felt like a 'big guy' moment.,"""Big guy?"""
Oh!,I got fired.
"Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell.","Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now everybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and..."
Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.,My mom will.
Maybe this wasn't your shot.,"Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finally get my shot, and I blow it!"
"Hard to tell, I was naked.","Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?"
Yeah? That's so nice!,"No, I don't think this was your shot. I mean, I don't even think you just get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! You've gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go 'I got the part! I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'."
"I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys.",
"Uh, Mon, you-you gonna leave your shoes out here?",Night.
Really? Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner?,Uh-huh!
She is a kook.,"Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever."
"Everybody? Shh, shhh. Uhhh... Central Perk is proud to present the music of Miss Phoebe Buffay.","If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes. No. Don't do this. This is stupid! I don't have to prove anything, I'm gonna go get them...But then everyone will know. Unless I get them, and then wake up really early and put them back! ...I need help!"
"Hi. Um, I want to start with a song thats about that moment when you suddenly realize what life is all about. OK, here we go. OK, thank you very much.",
,"Oh, great. This is just..."
"Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on.","Wow, this is so cool, you guys. The entire city is blacked out!"
"Pants and a sweater? Why, mom? Who am I gonna meet in a blackout? Power company guys? Eligible looters? Could we talk about this later? OK.","Wow, you guys, this is big."
,Can I borrow the phone? I want to call my apartment and check on my grandma. What's my number?
"Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre.","Well, I never call me."
"She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!","Hi Mom, it's Jill."
Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.,"Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just stuck at the bank, in an ATM vestibule."
"Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was some guy.","I'm fine. No, I'm not alone... I don't know, some guy."
Hi everyone.,
"Well, Chandler's old roomate was Jewish, and these are the only candles we have, so... Happy Chanukah, everyone.","And officiating at tonight's blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani."
,"Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles."
"Alright, alright, alright. It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. Oh God, do something. Just make contact, smile!",That had to hurt!
There you go!,
You're definitely scaring here.,
"Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with. Yeah, thanks.",Would you like to call somebody?
"Hey, it's me.",Hello?
"Yeah, I'm fine. I'm trppd in an ATM vstbl wth Jll Gdcr.",It's Chandler! Are you OK?
I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth Jll Gdcr!,What?
Put Joey on the phone.,I have no idea what you just said.
I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth JLL GDCR.,What's up man?
"Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.","Oh my God! He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Chandler, listen."
"OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table.","Alright, somebody."
That's my sister.,Whoooaa!
Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?,OK... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room on the second floor of the New York CIty public library.
Oh... Milwaukee.,"Pheebs, what about you?"
"Disneyland, 1989, 'It's a Small World After All.'",Um... Ross?
"The ride broke down. So, Carol and I went behind a couple of those mechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom.",No way!
"Oh come on, I already went.","Oh, Rachel."
Come on.,You did not go!
Step back.,"Oh, alright. The weirdest place would have to be... ... oh, the foot of the bed."
,We have a winner!
"Well, it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line.","I just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know, where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park."
Come on.,"There, well, see? Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf course."
And you didn't marry him because...?,"No, he said we were holding up the people behind us."
"Probably. But you know, I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated.","I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of..."
"It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you're left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. So, you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all that other good stuff.",Yeah right.
"But, um... I don't think that's going to be you.",OK.
"Uh-uh. See, I see.... big passion in your future.",You don't.
Mmmm.,Really?
I do.,You do?
,"Oh Ross, you're so great."
What?,It's never gonna happen.
What? Why not?,You and Rachel.
"No, no, no. I'm not in the zone.","Because you waited too long to make your move, and now you're in the friend zone."
"I'm taking my time, alright? I'm laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean, every day I get just a little bit closer to...","Ross, you're mayor of the zone."
"I will, I will. See, I'm waiting for the right moment. What? What, now?","Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking. If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever."
Shhhh!,"Yeeeeaaaahhh! What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight? You've just got to go up to her and say, 'Rachel, I think that...'"
We're shushing... because... we're trying to hear something. Listen. Don't you hear that?,What are you shushing?
See?,Ahhhh!
Would you like some gum?,Huh.
"Sorry, it's not.","Um, is it sugarless?"
"New York City has no power, and the milk is getting sour. But to me it is not scary, 'cause I stay away from dairy.... la la la, la la, la la...","Oh, then no thanks. What the hell was that? Mental note: If Jill Goodacre offers you gum, you take it. If she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it."
Are you going to do it?,"OK, here goes."
Do you want any help?,I'm going to do it.
"Good luck, man.","You come out there, you're a dead man."
OK.,Thanks. OK.
"Hey, where are you going?",
You can't go out there.,Outside.
Because of... the reason.,Why not?
"I, um, can't tell you.",And that would be?
"OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you.","Joey, what's going on?"
He's planning your birthday party.,About what?
You'd better act surprised.,Oh my God! I love him!
My surprise party!,About what?
Oh stop it. Joey already told me.,What surprise party?
"Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing.","Well, he didn't tell me."
"No, you are not. We tell you stuff.",This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.
Hmmm... this is so nice.,Yuh-huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in. Looks like I was second to last.
OK.,"OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment."
Ohhh!!!!,"OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um...."
"Oh, look at the little cat!","Yes, yes, that's right..."
,What? Ow!
This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.,"I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since..."
"Sorry, that was wax.",
Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?,"Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner."
Yeah?,During a blackout? He'd get trampled!
"Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things, right?","You know, on second thought, gum would be perfection. 'Gum would be perfection'? 'Gum would be perfection.' Could have said 'gum would be nice,' or 'I'll have a stick,' but no, no, no, no. For me, gum is perfection. I loathe myself."
"Er, yeah, it's mine.",Oh. Hi. We just found this cat and we're looking for the owner.
"Yeah, it's my cat. Give me my cat.",He seems to hate you. Are you sure?
Ehhhh... B-Buttons.,Wait a minute. What's his name?
"Mmm. Bob Buttons. Here, Bob Buttons.",Bob Buttons?
You owe me a cat.,Oooh! You are a very bad man!
,"Here, kitty-kitty. Here kitty-kitty. Where did you go, little kitty-kitty-kitty? Here kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty..."
Wow.,
"Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica.",Lucky sixes....
And Joey....,Hi!
And Ross.,Hi!
,Hi!
Monopoly!,He doesn't speak much English.
"So, um... where did Paolo come from?",Look at that!
"No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives.","Oh... Italy, I think."
"That, that is funny... .... and Rachel keeps touching him.","Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!"
Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.,
Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.,"Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat."
,"Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe."
"Ah, let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's good. It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. Here we go.",You betcha!
"Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth.",
,"Good save! We're back on track, and I'm... ..chewing someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're choking."
,Are you alright?
Yes... thank you. That was... that was....,"My God, you're choking! That better?"
,Perfection?
,"Blah blah blah, blah blah blah... blah blaaaaaah...."
I have absolutely no idea.,Wha-What did he say that was so funny?
"Oh my God, you guys, what am I doing? What am I doing? This is so un-me!",That's... that's classic.
,"If you want, I'll do it."
"God, the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry.","I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip. But I won't."
"Y'know, I know it's totally superficial and we have absolutely nothing in common, and we don't even speak the same language but Goooooooddddddd....","You know, did you ride mopeds? 'Cause I've heard... ... oh, I see... it's not about that right now. OK."
Paolo. Hi.,
,Ross!
Thing?,"Listen. Um, listen. Something you should... know... um, Rachel and I... we're kind of a thing."
"Ah, you... have the sex?","Thing, yes. Thing."
Bed?,"No, no, no. Technically the... sex is not... being had, but that's... see, that's not the point. See, um, the point is that... Rachel and I should be, er, together. You know, and if you get in the.... um..."
Oh!,"No, no, that's not where I was going. Er, if you get in the... way, of us becoming a thing, then I would be, well, very sad."
Si.,Yeah! Se vice?
Poco... a leetle.,So you do know a little English.
No.,Do you know the word crapweasel?
,"That's funny, because you know, you are a huge crapweasel!"
OK.,"Chandler, we've been here for an hour doing this! Now watch, it's easy."
,Ready?
,"No, you've got to whip it."
Thank you.,"Oh, look look look. The last candle's about to burn out. 10, 9, 8, 7... ... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48...."
Kinda... spooky without any lights.,Thanks.
,Bwah-hah-hah!
,"OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah..."
"Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica.",Oh.. oh... oh.
"Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.","Well, this has been fun."
,"Well, goodbye Chandler. I had a great blackout. See ya."
Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?,"Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape."
"Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'...","Question. You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody who would be perfect for you."
Yes please.,Do you want a date Saturday?
He's a he?,"Okay. He's cute, he's funny, he's-"
"...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?","Well yeah! ...Oh God. I- just- I thought- Good, Shelley. I'm just gonna go flush myself down the toilet now... Okay, goodbye..."
You did?,"Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe, possibly, you might be..."
"Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?","Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not."
"Yeah, I think so, yeah.",I did.
"Nono, me neither. Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor did.",Not me.
"No. No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so...",You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?
"Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?",
"Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?","I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny..."
WHAT IS IT?!,Yeah! Right!
Yes. Absolutely. A quality.,"Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality."
,"Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this."
"Oh my God! Calling from Rome! Bon giorno, caro mio.","Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome."
"Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome. I'm talking to Rome.",So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.
"So, uh, how's she doing?","Hey dad, what's up? Oh God. Ross, it's Nana."
"How-how are you, Mom?",The doctor says it's a matter of hours.
What?,"Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here. ...What's with your hair?"
Nothing.,What's different?
,"Oh, maybe that's it."
"Okay, relax, relax. We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.","She is unbelievable, our mother is..."
,Oh God!
The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.,
"Not just restaurants, from our house.","Oh! ...Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet 'n' Los. How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants."
Mrs. Geller?,
She looks so small.,
"Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now.",I know.
"Bye, Nana.","G'bye, Nana."
Ross!,
What is going on?!,
What?,"Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she's not, quite.."
What's going on?,"She's not- past, she's present, she's back."
She may have died?,She may have died.
,We're looking into it.
This almost never happens!,"I, uh, I'll go see."
Now she's passed.,
"Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair.","I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?"
,"Yeah, you have homosexual hair."
Twice.,"So, um, did she..."
"Oh, that sucks!",Twice?
"I dunno, it's weird. I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel, uh...",You guys okay?
"Nono, she's gone.",Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.
"Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every now and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know? Oh! And Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, y'know? ...I miss her.",We checked. A lot.
Thanks!,"Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this?"
"Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you're dead! You're gone! You're worm food! ...So Chandler looks gay, huh?",Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.
I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.,"Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie."
,"Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice!"
I don't see why not.,"Sweetie, you think you can get in there?"
Here's my retainer!,
Dad!,I was just thinking. When my time comes-
You what?,"Listen to me! When my time comes, I wanna be buried at sea."
Define fun.,"I wanna be buried at sea, it looks like fun."
"...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun.","C'mon, you'll make a day of it! You'll rent a boat, pack a lunch..."
That's probably what they'll say.,"Everyone thinks they know me. Everyone says 'Jack Geller, so predictable'. Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say 'Buried at sea! Huh!'."
"Hey, gorgeous.",I'd like that.
"No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake.","Hey. Look, I'm sorry about yesterday, I, um-"
"So, uh... what do you think it is about me?",Oh! Okay! Phew!
"...Quality, right, great.","I dunno, uh... you just have a-a..."
"Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?","Y'know, it's a shame, because you and Lowell would've made a great couple."
"Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll.",What? He's cute!
"No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.",Is Brian...?
Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not.,"Well, I think Brian's a little out of your league."
No.,This one?
"You know, whatever we pick, she would've told us it's the wrong one.","I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy."
Oh! A fine choice. I'm coming out.,You're right. We'll go with the burgundy.
,Wait! We need shoes!
That's really a day shoe.,"Okay. Um, how about these?"
Could we see something in a slimmer heel?,And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier?
"No, it really should be burgundy.","Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work."
"No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back.",Mm. Unless we go with a different dress?
Oh my God..,
"Yeah, just... just Nana stuff.","Is everything all right, dear?"
"How we doing, you guys ready?",
Some days it's all I can think about.,Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?
"Oh, you-you mean your earrings?","Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings."
Hm-m.,What'd I say?
Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.,Are these the shoes?
Morning. We ready to go?,"What, we-uh- we don't have shoes here, or...?"
,"Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that, isn't it?"
"It really was. Oh, c'mere, sweetheart. Y'know, I think it might be time for you to start using night cream.",It was a really beautiful service.
What?,
"Check it out, Giants-Cowboys.","Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger."
"No, it's the pre-game. I'm gonna watch it at the reception.",You're watching a football game at a funeral?
,"You are a frightening, frightening man."
"Oh, I hope they're not ruined.",Oh no! My new Paolo shoes!
"I know, uh, the air, the-the trees... even though Nana's gone there's, there's something almost, uh- I dunno, almost life-aff-","God, what a great day. ...What? Weather-wise!"
I'm fine. Just-just... having my worst fear realised...,God! Ross!
"What, what is it?","Okay, don't worry, I'm just checking to see if the muscle's in spasm...huh."
Oh! No-n-,You missed a belt loop.
"Here, sweetie, here. I took these when I had my golfing accident.","Okay, it's in spasm."
"Oh, no-",
"Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is.","Sorry- Hi, I'm Dorothy's daughter."
"Hey, look who's up! How do you feel?",
"Wow, those pills really worked, huh?","I feel great. I feel- great, I fleel great."
Ooh! That's so nice...,"Not the first two, but the second two- woooo! ...I love you guys. You guys are the greatest. I love my sister , I love Pheebs..."
Hey.,...Chandler!
You were right.,"And listen, man, if you wanna be gay, be gay. Doesn't matter to me."
"Oh, well you know who I love the most?",Rachel. Rachel Rachel. I love you the most.
You!,No.
,Oh.. you don't get it!
"Just a, uh... hearing disability.",Whaddya got there?
Seventeen-fourteen Giants... three minutes to go in the third.,What's the score?
,Beautiful!
Your grandmother would have hated this.,"Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker?"
"No, I'd be hearing about 'Why didn't I get the honey-glazed ham?', I didn't spend enough on flowers, and if I spent more she'd be saying 'Why are you wasting your money? I don't need flowers, I'm dead'.","Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all."
Do you know what it's like to grow up with someone who is critical of every single thing you say?,That sounds like Nana.
"I'm telling you, it's a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive, life-affirming person that she is.",...I can imagine.
Tell her what?,"That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?"
I'm not sure I know what you're getting at.,"How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair... for example."
...No. I think some things are better left unsaid. I think it's nicer when people just get along.,Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the truth?
"More wine, dear?",Huh.
Those earrings look really lovely on you.,"Oh, I think so."
Actually they were Nana's.,Thank you. They're yours.
Now I'm depressed! ... Even more than I was.,
That little naked guy would be me.,"Hey, who's this little naked guy?"
"Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?","Aww, look at the little thing."
Got me.,Who are those people?
"Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?","Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. 'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'."
Looks like a fun gang.,"Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?"
"Nono, that would be me again. I'm, uh, just trying something.","Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!"
"Hey, Chandler.","Hey, Lowell."
It's like Mardi Gras without the paper mache heads. How 'bout you?,So how's it going there in Financial Services?
I know. That's what I told her.,"Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I'm not."
Yeah.,Really.
"Pretty much, most of the time. We have a kind of... radar.",So- you can tell?
"Speaking for my people, I'd have to say no. By the way, your friend Brian from Payroll, he is.","So you don't think I have a, a quality?"
"Yup, and waaay out of your league.",He is?
"Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?","Out of my league. I could get a Brian. If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. Hey, Brian."
"It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job.",An advance?
"Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'. I'm with you. Um, but I, but I'm trying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee? Oh, look at that.","Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart. You're a terrible, terrible waitress. Really, really awful."
Huh?,"Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, do you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?"
,"Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before. Only $98.50 to go."
"No, they're not.","Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?"
You're wrong.,"Yes, they are. The Blymens invited them."
You're wrong.,I am not wrong.
I'm calling Mom.,"No, I just talked to them."
"Hey, hey.",
Hey.,Hey.
"Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model.",And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?
What were you modeling for?,"That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman."
"Oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those ""healthy, healthy, healthy guys""?",You know those posters for the city free clinic?
Do you know which one you're gonna be?,"You know, the asthma guy was really cute."
"Good luck, man. I hope you get it.","No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so..."
,Thanks.
"Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's.","Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It's Thanksgiving."
"You know, they're not actually supposed to have... I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right?",Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?
"And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays.",Yeah.
"Phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma?","Yes, every single one of them."
"So you're free Thursday, then.","Yes, and her boyfriend. But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December 'cause he is lunar."
"Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?","Yeah. Oh, can I come?"
I thought it was $98.50.,"Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go."
"Well, I'm off to Carol's.","Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup."
"Ooh, ooh. Because she's my ex-wife, and will probably want to bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.","Ooh, ooh! Why don't we invite her?"
"No, she's at a faculty meeting.","Hi, is uh, is Carol here?"
"Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.","Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...Susan: Come in."
Kinda like a big face without skin.,What's it look like?
"Ok. Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian.","Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it."
"Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.","Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it."
"The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?","Actually, I'm reading it to the baby."
"You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?","What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there?"
"Do you uh, do you talk about me?","Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice."
Really?,"Yeah, yeah, all the time."
"Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.","But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy."
"I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.","Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say."
"Hey, Rach, did you make your money?",
"Rach, here's your mail.","No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop."
"No, here's your mail.","Thanks, you can just put it on the table."
Would you just open it?,"Thanks, you can just put it on the table."
"Oh my god, oh, you guys are great.",
We did?,We all chipped in.
Thank you. Thank you so much!,You owe me 20 bucks.
"Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?","Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns."
"Oh, I hate this story.","All right, I'm nine years old."
Oh my god.,"We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced."
"Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together.",Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
"Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy. Aramis? Aramis?",We did?
I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business.,"Yeah, right."
"I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back.",Get out.
"Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing?",Really? You don't know what that means to me.
"Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?",Nothing.
What's wrong?,Yeah. Oh.
Oh. What?,"I just remembered, I have to do something."
"Wait, wait, wait!","Um, leave."
So I guess you all saw it.,
"No, we were just laughing. You know, how laughter can be infectious.",Saw what?
"Tonight, on a very special Blossom.",Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.
I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.,"Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming. What?"
That's closer.,"All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping."
"I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop.",
"Ok, I'm gonna get my stuff.","Oh, you must stop shooping."
"No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.","Chandler, will you just come in already?"
"Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!",
,"Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore."
That's not a question.,"Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots."
"All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots.","But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease."
,"Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child."
"Ok, Mom never hit.",Ah!
"Ok, all done.",
"Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.","What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!"
"Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died.",Why would we do that?
"Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything. Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!","Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up."
The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.,
"No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?",The balloon?
Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?,"I can't, I gotta go."
Got the keys? or Got the keys!,Almost never.
,Ok.
"Ok, ok, here we go. Ok, where am I talking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but...",Anytime you're ready.
"Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can't do this. Uh, this is too weird. I feel stupid.",Just aim for the bump.
"Hello, baby. Hello, hello.","So don't do it, it's fine. You don't have to do it just because Susan does it."
"Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean.",I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park.
We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.,"Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here?"
"Yes, you do. When we left, you said, ""got the keys.""",No I don't.
"No, no, no, you said, ""got the keys"".","No I didn't. I asked, ""got the ke-eys?"""
The oven is on.,Do either of you have the keys?
"Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key.","Oh, I gotta get my ticket!"
That tone will not make me go any faster.,"Well then get it, get it!"
That one will.,Joey!
"And everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major. So, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus. You're just happy you don't have gills anymore.",
"Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok?","Look, you don't have to talk to it. You can sing to it if you want."
"Hi, how's it goin?",
I did.,"Shh! Here we come, walkin' down the street, get the funniest looks from, everyone we meet. Hey, hey! Hey, uh, did you just feel that?"
"No, no that was the first.","Does it always, uh--?"
"Hey, hey, you're my baby, and I can't wait to meet you. When you come out I'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo.",Keep singing! Keep singing!
"Hey, hey, I'm your daddy. I'm the one without any breasts.",I felt it!
Can you go any faster with that?,"Nope, not that one."
Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?,"Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math."
"All right, listen, smirky. If it wasn't for you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman do this right now. But I'm not.",For an emergency just like this.
"No, I didn't. I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I obviously didn't have the keys.",I swear you said you had the keys.
,"Ooh, ok, that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys."
Aside from the fact that you said you had them?,Why would I have the keys?
"Well, you should have.",But I didn't.
Because!,Why?
Because!,Why?
"Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go.","Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I... I..."
"Well, the turkey's burnt. Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined.",
"Here we come, walkin' down thethis doesn't smell like Mom's.",
"Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuck here with you guys.","No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one."
"Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner?","Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice."
,You call that delicious?
Now this feels like Thanksgiving.,"Stop it, stop it, stop it!"
Ooh.,
Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven. Oh my god. He's not alone. Ugly Naked Guy's having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.,What?
I've gotta see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy!,
It's nice that he has someone.,"Ooh, Ugly Naked Dancing!"
Shall I carve?,
"Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?",By all means.
Does anybody wanna split this with me?,I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese.
"Ooh, you guys have to make a wish.","Oh, I will."
"Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?",Make a wish?
"I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.",The bigger half.
"And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.",That's so sweet.
"Here, here!",And a crappy New Year.
He's finally happy with that and walks away.,Bladder Control Problem Stop Wife Beating Hemorrhoids? Winner of 3 Tony Awards...
,Guys? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet.
W-wait. What is that?,Oooh!
"No, no, I don't.",'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?
My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.,"Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him?"
"Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!",That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?
"Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so...","Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?"
"Nah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe- ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'really cool way to live'.",Why don't you just get a roommate?
Might wanna open with the snowman.,"So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman."
"Hey, Joey. Hey, buddy.",
"Ahhhhhh, I didn't get the job.","So, how'd it go?"
"I dunno. Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager. He's not even jolly, it's all political.",How could you not get it? You were Santa last year.
"Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face, y'know?",So what are you gonna be?
"Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud!","Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's? Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's?"
"Yeah, you wish!","Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you."
"Yeah, okay. Alright.","It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner."
Woooo! Yeah!,"Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm."
"Oh, oh, good.","Phoebe, you're on."
"Thanks, hi. Um, I wanna start with a song that means a lot to me this time of year.","Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand, Miss Phoebe Buffay. Wooh!"

"Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!","No. No, that's- that's okay."
Noth- I was- I was just saying to my-,That guy's going home with a note!
"Sorry, I wa- I was just saying to my friend that I thought you were the most beautiful woman that I'd ever seen in my- in my life. And then he said that- you said you thought",Could you speak up please?
"Daryl Hannah was the most beautiful woman that he'd ever seen in his life and I said yeah, I liked her in Splash, a lot, but not so much in- in Wall Street, I thought she had kind of a",Daryl Hannah.
"-hard quality. And uh, while Daryl Hannah is beautiful in a conventional way, you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace. Then, uh, that-that-that's when you started yelling.",Hard quality.
"Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note!","Okay, we're gonna take a short break."
"Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. I mean God, by my sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! ...Ooh. Did I just share too much?","Come here, Marcel. Sit here."
"David's like, y'know, Scientist Guy. He's very methodical.",Just a smidge.
Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?,I think it's romantic.
"Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions...",Yeah!
"No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?","Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonna ask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the pact."
What?!,"Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice."
"I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped.","C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact!"
"I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!","Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!"
"Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late.",
Too many jokes... must mock Joey!,
"Aah, y'killing me!","Nice shoes, huh?"
Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again!,
Do you always have to bring him here?,"Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?"
"Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.","I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces..."
"Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.","Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me."
"Okay, alright, I have a question, then.","...But, you can't actually test this theory, because today's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions."
"Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?",Yuh.
Sure.,"Uh, that's definitely a, uh, valid question. And, uh, the answer would be yes. Yes I was. But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, 'cause it's you."
"Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body.","Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be, and now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one of those things where I just like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. And, uh, I'm not really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella."
"Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and throw me.",Rrrreally.
"Oh yeah, right now.",...Now? Now?
"Okay, now you're just kinda tidying.","Okay, okay, okay. Y'know what, this was just really expensive. And I'll take- this was a gift."
I can hop.,"Okay, what the hell, what the hell. You want me to actually throw you or you-you wanna just hop?"
So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?,
Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?,"I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby."
You know more than one Fun Bobby?,Yeah.
"Okay, here we go...",I happen to know a Fun Bob.
There. Now there is.,"Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!"
"Uh, four.","Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates."
Five.,Four.
Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight.,Five.
"Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops?","Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to do?"
"Hey, y'know, this is so not what I needed right now.","Oh, c'mon. We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll know who's with who."
"Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands...",What's the matter?
Really.,"That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night."
"What, uh... what juggling thing?","Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing."
No.,With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.
,"Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a melon..."
"Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody?",Phoebe. Hi.
"No, no, he hasn't been around.",No. Have you seen David?
Minsk?,"Well, if you see him, tell him to pack his bags. We are going to Minsk."
I know where Minsk is.,Minsk. It's in Russia.
"So when, when do you leave?","We got the grant. Three years, all expenses paid."
Hello?,January first.
Hi.,Hey!
"Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so congratulations! This is so exciting!",Hi! What-what're you doing here?
"Oh, you're not going? Oh, why?",It'd be even more exciting if we were going.
"Thank you, Max. Thank you.","Tell her, David. 'I don't wanna go to Minsk and work with Lifson and Yamaguchi and Flench, on nonononononono. I wanna stay here and make out with my girlfriend!!'"
I don't know. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I just- you decide.,So-so you're really not going?
Please.,Oh don't do that.
"No, but I'm asking-",Oh no no.
"No, but I can't-","Oh, but I can't do that-"
-make the decision-,"It's your thing, and-"
Stay.,"Okay, um, stay."
,Stay.
It was Max's stuff.,Getting so good at that!
You remember Janice.,"I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow!"
,Vividly.
"Hi, I'm Sandy.",Hi.
"Yeah. That's okay, right?",Sandy! Hi! C'mon in! ...You brought your kids.
Par-tay!,
"'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your home?",That thing is not coming in here.
Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened...,I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.
"Thank you. C'mon, Marcel, whaddya say you and I do a little mingling? Alright, I'll, uh... catch up with you later.",Alright. Just keep him away from me.
"Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where-where's Paolo?",
And then... your face is bloated?,Rome. Jerk missed his flight.
,"No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party? Are people eating my dip?"
"Wow, that's, uh, dirty.","Y'know, when I saw you at the store last week, it was probably the first time I ever mentally undressed an elf."
,Yeah.
"Look at him. I'm not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in.","Hey, kids..."
But you found me!,"There you are! Haaah, you got away from me!"
Kill me. Kill me now.,"Here, Ross, take our picture. Smile! You're on Janice Camera!"
Hey everybody! It's Fun Bobby!,
"Hey, sorry I'm late. But my, uh, grandfather, he- died about two hours ago. But I-I-I couldn't get a flight out 'til tomorrow, so here I am!",
,Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died?
"It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.",
"Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-","Oh, I'm gonna blow this one up, and I'm gonna write 'Reunited' in glitter."
I'm sorry you misunderstood...,"Oh, no. Oh, no."
,"Oh my God. You listen to me, Chandler, you listen to me. One of these times is just gonna be your last chance with me."
,"Oh, will you give me the thing."
Yoko. I've decided to go to Minsk without you.,"Hi, Max!"
It won't be the same- but it'll still be Minsk. Happy New Year.,Wow.
"Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.",Are you alright?
You're going to Minsk.,
"Oh, you are so going to Minsk. You belong in Minsk. You can't stay here just 'cause of me.","No, I'm... not going to Minsk."
"Oh yes, yes, yes you can. Just say, um, 'Phoebe, my work is my life and that's what I have to do right now'. And I say 'your work?! Your work?! How can you say that?!'. And then you say, um, 'it's tearing me apart, but I have no choice. Can't you understand that?'. And I say 'no! No! I can't understand that!'.","Yes I can. Because if I go it means I have to break up with you, and I can't break up with you."
"Ooh, sorry. Um, and, and then you put your arms around me. And then you put your arms around me. And, um, and then you tell me that you love me and you'll never forget me.","Uh, ow."
And then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go because you don't wanna start the new year with me if you can't finish it. I'm gonna miss you. You scientist guy.,I'll never forget you.
,"Hi, this is Dick Clark, live in Times Square. We're in a virtual snowstorm of confetti here in Times Square..."
And then the peacock bit me. Please kiss me at midnight.,"There y'go, kids."
"Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you.",You seen Sandy?
What?,"Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing."
In twenty seconds it'll be midnight...,The bll is drrbing!
Looks like that no date pact thing worked out.,And the moment of joy is upon us.
Not everybody's happy. Hey Bobby!,Everybody looks so happy. I hate that.
"Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz, but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here.",
I can't kiss anyone.,I dunno. I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight.
"Nonono, you can't kiss Ross, that's your brother.",So I'm kissing everyone?
"Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody kiss me!",Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me.
"I wanted this to work so much. I mean I'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas... but he's just phoning it in. Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love you back.",Alrightalrightalright. There.
Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?,...I think that bitch cracked my tooth.
"Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.",Why?
"Where? Ooh, come to Momma.","Oh my God. Phoebe. Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression."
,"He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool."
Thanks.,Nice hat.
We should do something. Whistle.,
"Come on, do it.",We are not going to whistle.
Do it!,No!
Do it do it do it!,No!
,Woo-woo!
"Why did I 'woo-hoo'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That-that he'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'?",I can't believe you did that!
"Phoebe, what are you doing?","I just wish there was something we could do. Hello. Hello, Coma Guy. GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT! UP! UP! UP!"
"I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer.",Maybe nobody's tried this.
"Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can dance!","Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's artistic."
I wish all guys could be like him.,"Oh! And, he's the kinda guy who, when you're talking, he's listening, y'know, and not saying 'Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked."
Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?,I know.
"Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible.",He doesn't have anyone.
"Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up!",I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo.
,"Folks, when we come back we'll be talking about her new book, 'Euphoria Unbound': the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing. You might wanna put the kids to bed for this one."
"No way, forget it.","Y'know, we don't have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie's is on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax."
"Exactly. Weekend At Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No?","C'mon, she's your mom!"
"Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'","Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books! I love her books! I cannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool!"
You can say that because she's not your mom.,"C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast."
,"Oh, please..."
"Oh, hi sweetie.",Bona sera.
Last night.,When did Rigatoni get back from Rome?
Hey hey hey! She's on!,"Ah, so then his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?... Just a dream I had- but, phew."
...Now what is this about you-you being arrested i-in London? What is that all about?,Ah! Nora Bing!
"Shhh, busy beaming with pride.",Your mom was arrested?
Now why would she say that's embarrassing?,"...This is kind of embarrassing, but occasionally after I've been intimate with a man..."
...I just get this craving for Kung Pow Chicken.,Shhh.
"Alright, so now you're doing this whole book tour thing, how is that going?",THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!
Awww!,"Oh, fine. I'm leaving for New York tomorrow, which I hate- but I get to see my son, who I love..."
"Y'know, don't take this wrong, I-I just don't see you a-as a mom, somehow.. I don't mean that, I don't mean that bad...",This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.
,"Oh no, I am a fabulous mom! I bought my son his first condoms."
"Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams played sports.",...And then he burst into flames.
What about Glen? He could be a Glen.,
Ooh! How about Agamemnon?,Nah... not-not special enough.
I am famished. What do I want...,Waaay too special.
"Oh, you watched the show! What'd you think?",Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken.
What is this dive? Only you could've picked this place.,"Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little."
I know I am.,"Oooh, c'mon, shut up, it's fun. Gimme a hug. Well, I think we're ready for some tequila."
Yeah.,Who's doing shots?
There y'go. Ross?,I'm in.
,"Uh, I'm not really a shot drinking kinda guy."
...But a man can change.,"Hi! Sorry- sorry we're late, we, uh, kinda just, y'know, lost track of time."
Anyone want me to appraise anything?,
"Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you, I've read everything you've ever written. No, I mean it! I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become a writer.",
"Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen.","Oh, please, honey, listen, if I can do it, anybody can. You just start with half a dozen European cities, throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia, and bam! You have got yourself a book."
"Yeah, any messages for room 226?",
"You okay there, slugger?",
What is with you tonight?,"Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine."
"Okay, thank you. It's the Italian Hand-Licker, isn't it.",Nothing. Nothing nothing nothing.
She's supposed to be with you.,No. It's the one he's licking.
"Oh, Ross, listen to me. I have sold a hundred million copies of my books, and y'know why?",You're good.
"No. Because I know how to write men that women fall in love with. Believe me, I cannot sell a Paolo. People will not turn three hundred twenty-five pages for a Paolo. C'mon, the guy's a secondary character, a, y'know, complication you eventually kill off.",The girl on the cover with her nipples showing?
He's not a hero. ...You know who our hero is.,When?
"No, it's you!",The guy on the cover with his nipples showing?
"No, really, c'mon. You're smart, you're sexy...",Please.
"You are gonna be fine, believe me.",Right.
Uh-oh...,
,
"Hey, is Chandler here?",Uhhhh.... I'll just pee in the street.
,Yeah.
Right. No big deal.,"Okay, uh, about last night, um, Chandler.. you didn't tell... Okay, 'cause I'm thinking- we don't need to tell Chandler, I mean, it was just a kiss, right? One kiss? No big deal? Right?"
In Bizarro World!! You broke the code!,Okay.
"You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!",What code?
What are you guys doing out here?,
"Yeah, well, you don't have your racket.","Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept."
"Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size.","No, no I don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed to bring me one."
"Okay, I'm scum, I'm scum.","Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together."
"I don't know, God, I... well, it's not like she's a regular mom, y'know? She's, she's sexy, she's...","Ross, how could you let this happen?"
Well... not in the same way...,You don't think my mom's sexy?
"Okay, I think we're getting into a weird area here...","I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?"
Hey.,
What're you guys doing out here?,Hey.
He forgot to leave his grip size!,"Well, not playing raquetball!"
"Well,sounds like you two have issues.",He didn't get the goggles!
"Goodbye, baby.",
,"Ciao, bela."
,Do they wait for me to do this?
Why would I tell him?,So are you gonna tell him?
Oh...,"How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might."
Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!,What are you guys doing here?
Hi.,...What did I ask?
What are you doing here?,Hi.
I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off...on the way.. my way... Do you come here a lot? Without me?,"Nothing, I just thought I'd stop by.. y'know, after the uh... that I.. y'know, so what are you doing here?"
How would I know? I-I wasn't here.,"No. No! No! ...So, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?"
Oh my God.,"Really? Not even to, um, change his PAJAMAS?!"
I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?,You're my friend. I-I had to tell you.
What?,"Yeah, um, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you know how he gets when he's drun..uh... I can't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm sorry, I kissed your mom."
You knew about this?,"I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much tequila, and Nora- um, Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- But nothing happened, nothing- Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in-"
"I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!","Uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing."
"Thanks, man, big help.","Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows what woulda happened."
"I wasn't- I mean, I-",I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?
I know-,"Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you."
Chandler-,I can't believe you did this.
I'm still mad at you for not telling me.,"Me neither, y'know what-"
Chandler-,What are you mad at me for?!
"Chandler, I didn't kiss her, he did! See what happens when you break the code?",You gotta let me slam the door!
Ah! Huh?,Joey-
Hey.,Hey.
"Yeah. Thought I'd give it a shot. I'm still on the first chapter. Now, do you think his 'love stick can be liberated from its denim prison'?","'A Woman Undone, by Rachel Karen Green'."
Hey Rach.,"Yeah, I'd say so. And there's no 'j' in 'engorged'."
Hello.,Hey.
Going to the hospital tonight?,Hello.
"No, you?","No, you?"
"Okay, maybe it was a trick question. Um, Rachel can we do this now?",You just asked me.
"Now, here's a picture of my mother and father on their wedding day. Now you tell me she's not a knockout.",Okay. I am so hot!
"C'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all.",I cannot believe we're having this conversation.
"Thanks. Hi, um, 'kay. I'd like to start with a song that's about a man that I recently met, who's, um, come to be very important to me. 'Kay.",Central Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe Buffay.
"Okay, thank you very much, I'm gonna take a short break!","You don't have to be awake to be my man, As long as you have brainwaves I'll be there to hold your hand. Though we just met the other day, There's something I have got to say..."
,"Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay, everybody. Woo!"
"Oh, uh, Phoebe just started a...",What was that?
Mother-Kisser... I'll shut up.,"Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, alright there, Mother-Kisser?"
"Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian nightmare.","Chandler, can I just say something? I-I know you're still mad at me, I just wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips."
"Because it's complicated, it's complex- Hey, you kissed my mom!","Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?"
We're rehearsing a Greek play.,
"No! Okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell her how you feel?",That's very funny. We done now?
"Okay, 'you' can't, or you can't? Okay, that's my finger. That's, that's my knee. Still doing the play. Aaah!","That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her."
,"Alright, whadyou do with him?"
"Look at you! How, how do you feel?",Oh! You're awake!
You look good!,"Uh, a little woozy, but basically okay."
"Oh, sorry.",I feel good! ...Who are you?
I'm Monica Geller. I've been taking care of you.,I'm Phoebe Buffay.
"So, the Etch-a-Sketch is from you guys?","Well, we both have."
I got you the foot massager.,"Well, actually it's just from me."
I read to you.,You know who shaved you? That was me.
"Well,... thanks.",I sang. Hah!
You're welcome.,"Oh, my pleasure."
"What, that's it?",So. I guess I'll see you around.
"Well, what do you want me to say?","""See you around?"""
"Alright, I'll call you.","Oh, I don't know. Maybe, um, ""That was nice?"" Admit something to me? ""I'll call you?"""
"This is so typical. Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then- we just get nothing back! And then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and ""See you around!"" Let's go, Phoebe.",I don't think you mean that.
"Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?",Y'know what? We thought you were different. But I guess it was just the coma.
"Alright, well, be good, I love you.","No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough."
"O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid.",You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.
"Really stupid. And I don't even know how it happened. I'm sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again. Are we okay now?",Really stupid.
,Yeah. No. No...
"Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.","Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door."
"No, no. He said ""When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?""",You're kidding.
"Then she came back with ""The question is, when are you gonna grow up and realise I have a bomb?""",Wow!
That makes more sense.,"'Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn't say ""When are you gonna grow up and realise I am your mom?"""
"I dunno, I've been standing here spelling it out for you! I don't hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait.","So, what's going on now?"
"Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down. Wait, wait. They're walking away... they're walking away... No, no they're not, they're coming right at us! Run! Run!",Whaddya see?
"You okay, kiddo?",
Alright.,"Yeah, okay."
,Nice save.
Mr. Geller.,Mrs. Bing.
,
You mean that?,Hey.
Yeah? How'd it go?,"Yeah, why not. So I told her."
"Well, howdya feel?",Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse.
"Well, see? So, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, y'know, me kissing your mom, uh? Huh? But.. we don't have to go down that road.",Pretty good! I told her.
What's a 'niffle'?,"Okay. Now this is just the first chapter, and I want your absolute honest opinion. Oh, oh, and on page two, he's not 'reaching for her heaving beasts'."
"Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist...",You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'.
"Alright, that's it! Give it back! That's it!","Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? Tell ya, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!"
"No-no-no-no, we're done.",Nooo!
,"Aunt Syl, stop yelling! All I'm saying is that if you had told me vegetarian lasagna, I would have made vegetarian lasagna. Well, the meat's only every third layer, maybe you could scrape."
"Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no compass, and I can find my way out of there like that!","Ross, did you really read all these baby books?"
"And, we're done with the yogurt.","Ooh, this is cool...it says in some parts of the world, people actually eat the placenta."
"Aunt Syl, I did this as a favor, I am not a caterer. What do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas? Nice talk, Aunt Syl. You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?",Sorry.
"Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big? This is your baby. Hi Daddy!",
How come you don't live with Mommy? How come Mommy lives with that other lady? What's a lesbian?,Hello!
"Honey, you can say it, Poconos, Poconos, it's like Poc-o-nos",
"Mma, Mma, Mmaah","Ah, poke a nose, mmm"
"So, did I hear Poconos?",
"Woo-hoo, first weekend away together!","Yes, my sister's giving us her place for the weekend."
I know...,"Yeah, that's a big step."
"Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal!",
,"Wasn't this supposed to be just a fling, huh? Shouldn't it be... flung by now?"
,"I mean, we are way past the fling thing, I mean, I am feeling things that I've only read about in Danielle Steele books, you know? I mean, when I'm with him, I'm totally, totally..."
"I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes, and their little baby hands...","...nauseous, I'm physically nauseous. What am I supposed to do, huh? Call immigration? I could call immigration!"
,"Ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever!"
You think?,Need a new table.
,"Hey hey, come on in!"
"Oh great! Is it vegetarian, 'cause Susan doesn't eat meat.","Hey, hello! mmwa! I brought all the books, and Monica sends her love, along with this lasagna."
"So, I got the results of the amnio today.",I'm pretty sure that it is...
Totally and completely healthy!,"Oh, tell me, tell me, is everything, uhh....?"
"Hey, when did you and Susan meet Huey Lewis?","Oh, that's great, that is great!"
Of course it's your friend Tanya.,"Uh, that's our friend Tanya."
"The sex? Um, I'm having enough trouble with the image of you and Susan together, when you throw in Tanya , yaw...",Don't you want to know about the sex?
"Oh, you know the sex of the baby? Oh, oh-oh-oh!","The sex of the baby, Ross."
"No, no, no, no, no, I don't want to know, absolutely not. I think, you know, I think you should know until you look down there, and say, oop, there it is! Or isn't...",Do you want to know?
"Oh, hello Ross!",
"So, so, did you hear?",Susan...
"Oh, that's so... It really is...do we know...?","Yes, we did, everything's A-OK!"
"Oh, hey hey hey, ho ho ho, hello, guy who doesn't want to know, standing right here!","Yes, we certainly do, it's going to be..."
Mm-hmmm,"Oh, well, is it what we thought it would be?"
It's a...,"Ok, what, what...ok, what did we think it was going to be?"
"Well, thanks for the books.","No, no, no I don't want to know, don't want to know. Ok, you know, I should probably, I should probably just go."
"All right, who should we call first, your folks, or Deb and Rona?","No problem, ok, mmmwa oh, mmmwa Susan..."
"Uh, never mind, I don't want to know.",Hello?
That's the rule.,"Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?"
How'd you get to that?,"What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!"
You knew about that?,"Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio"
"Ok, ok, How about if we split it?","Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination."
Yeah,"What do you mean, like, buy it together?"
Why not?,You think we're ready for something like that?
"Why, are you moving out?","Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?"
You'd tell me if you were moving out right,I'm not moving out.
"Aw, I know all about Kip!","Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip..."
"Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?","It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly."
We've got a couple changes in your schedule. Your 4:00 herbal massage has been pushed back to 4:30 and Miss Somerfield canceled her 5:30 shiatsu.,"Aw, don't do that"
"Oh, here comes your 3:00. I don't mean to sound unprofessional, but, yum","Ok, thanks."
"Oh, Paolo, hi, what are you doing here?","Buon Giorno, Bella Phoebe!"
"Well, Racquela's right, yeah!","Uh, Racquela tell me you massage, eh?"
"Oh, okay, I don't know what you just said, so let's get started.",
"Um, that's really your decision, I mean, some people prefer, you know, to take off...oh whoops! You're being naked!","Uh, I am, uh, being naked?"
And Monica knows...,"I can't believe you don't want to know. I mean, I couldn't not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and Susan knows...."
"Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me.","Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!"
"Waitohheyhuh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know!",So what's it gonna be?
Or an uncle...,"I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt!"
Hey Phoebe!,
Pheebs!,Hi Pheebs!
"Phoebe, what's the matter?",Fine!
"Hey, can we get some cappuccino over here?","Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts."
"Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on.","Oh, right, that's me!"
"Phoebe, what is it?",Fine.
"I'm familiar with his work, yes...","All right, you know Paolo?"
,"Well, he made a move on me."
"More coffee over here, please!","Whoa, store will be open tomorrow!"
"Well, he came in for a massage, and everything was fine until.","Well, what happened?"
Ooooohh!,
Are you sure?,My God.
,
Was it...?,"Oh yeah, I'm sure. And all of a sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore."
Oooooo....,"Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there."
"""Ooo,"" what?",
Oh!,Uma Thurman.
,The actress!
,Thanks Rach.
"You have to tell her! You have to tell her! It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys?",So what are you gonna do?
Feminist issue. That's where I went!,"Oh, yeah, you have to tell her."
"Yeah, well...",She is gonna hate me.
That's patio furniture!,"Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one?"
What about the birds?,"So what, like people are gonna come in and think, ""Uh-oh, I'm outside again?"" Of course!"
You pick one.,"I don't know, birds just don't say, ""Hello, sit here, eat something."""
"Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!","All right, how about the ladybugs?"
"Not like that, I won't! Kip would have liked the birds!","Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!"
Hi Pheebs!,Hey!
"No, these aren't all my suitcases. This one's Paolo's.",Are you moving out?
"Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over.","Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec?"
"Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs...","Oh! Ok, um, ok, um,"
"Ok, thanks Pheebs Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!","Ok, um, we haven't known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me. One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world."
"All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.","Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies"
I guess you don't.,Which proves that I never lie.
,Paolo made a pass at me.
I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.,"So, what do you think?"
,I know!
"Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!","So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?"
,Heads up Ross! Score! You suck!
I need some milk.,Are you okay?
"No...oh, I feel so stupid! Oh, I think about the other day with you guys and I was all ""Oh, Paolo, he's so great, he makes me feel so..."" Oh, God, I'm so embarrassed!","Ok, I've got milk Here you go... Oh! Better?"
,"I'm so embarrassed, I'm the one he hit on!"
I'm so sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry!,"Pheebs, if I had never met him this never would have happened!"
"I don't know...right, he's the pig!","No, wait, oh, what are we sorry about?"
"Oh, God, he's such a pig,",Such a pig!
He's like a big disgusting...,Oh he's like a...
...pig...pig man!,...like a...
"Oh, but he was my pig man...how did I not see this?","Yes, good! Ok..."
"Ok, Ok, Pheebs...","Oh! I know! It's because... he's gorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you..."
"Oh, God...",The end.
"No, no, trust, me, it's, it's, it's much better that I know. Uh, I just liked it better before it was better...",Should I not have told you?
"I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...",
"Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts.",We should get over there and see if she's okay. Just one...second! Score! Game! Come on.
"Come on, two on one.","No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team."
"What, now?","What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!"
"My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her. You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross!","Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!"
,"No, that's cold, that's cold, that's..."
"Don't stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony, now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, , Ok, that is either, ""How could you?"" or, ""Enormous breasts!"" Here he comes!",How's it going?
,Ooh!
"Oh, ok bye-bye.","Uh, I am, uh, to say good-bye."
Grazie.,"Paolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel, but I still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles."
"Oh, just look at her...","Paolo, I-I just want to tell you and I think I speak for everyone when I say..."
"Oh, you're right.","Oh you guys, I-I really think just one of us should go out there so she's not overwhelmed..."
,...and I really think it should be me.
Hey.,Hey.
"Ooh, I've been better...",You all right?
"Oh, Ross...","Come here. Listen, you deserve so much better than him...you know, I mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you."
"I am so sick of guys. I don't want to look at another guy, I don't want to think about another guy, I don't even want to be near another guy.",What?
"Oh Ross, you're so great!",Huh.
,Ohhhh
Oh...,"Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?"
...medium...hmm...any cookies left?,You ok?
"See, Rach, uh, see, I don't think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer. I really don't. I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process.",Yep!
"Uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a Paolo.","No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just got to figure out what I want"
What?,"No, I know, I know, and I'm sure your little boy is not going to grow up to be one."
"I-I'm, I'm having a boy?",What?
"Wha-I'm having, I'm having a boy! Huh, am I having a boy?","Uh...no. No, no, in fact, you're not having a boy."
"I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy!","Yes, you're having a boy!"
Wha-,
What is it?,Wha-
Hey!,I'm having a boy! I-I'm having a boy!
We already knew that!,Hey!
,I'm having a son. Um...
Shut-out!!,Yes! And that would be a shut-down!
"Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!","Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!"
"You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies! All right, ok, I gotta go. I'm going, and I'm gone.","Yeah, get out!"
Oh yeah!,One more game?
I'm sorry!,"That is it! You just barge in here, you don't knock"
"Rachel, wait, wait.",You have no respect for anybody's privacy!
Can I just say one thing?,"No, you wait! This is ridiculous!"
That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular areas.,What? What?!
,Oh!!
That's pretty much it.,"Oh, honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks things are, like, other things. Y'know? Like, the phone rings and she takes a shower."
"But you tell it really well, sweetie.",Oops!
Okay. I'll miss you.,"Thanks. Okay, now go away so we can talk about you."
He's so cute! And he seems to like you so much.,Isn't he great?
"So, you think you'll do it on his couch?","I know, I know. So sweet... and so complicated. And for a shrink, he's not too shrinky, y'know?"
Okaaay. Any of you guys want anything else?,"Oh, I don't know, I don't know. I think that's a little weird, y'know? Vinyl."
"No, I'm sorry, we're all out of those. Anybody else?","Oh, yes, could I have one of those."
"Did I, uh, did I miss something?",Okay.
You what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?,"No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies."
"Okay, okay, could we change the subject, please?",It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts.
"Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change.","Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts."
"Nice? They were nice. I mean, that's it? I mean, mittens are nice.","Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies."
You're so funny! He's really funny! I wouldn't wanna be there when when the laughter stops.,"Okaaay, rock, hard place, me."
"Oh, just seems as though that maybe you have intimacy issues. Y'know, that you use your humour as a way of keeping people at a distance.","Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that?"
"I mean hey! I just met you, I don't know you from Adam. ...Only child, right? Parents divorced before you hit puberty.",Huh.
It's textbook.,"Uhhuh, how did you know that?"
"Hey you guys. Hey, you all know my dad, right?",
"Hey, how long are you in the city?","Hey! Hey, Mr. Trib!"
"Oh, this is my friend Roger.",Just for a coupla days. I got a job midtown. I figure I'm better off staying with the kid than hauling my ass back and forth on the ferry. I don't know this one.
"Hey, hey. Good to meet you, Roger.",Hi.
"What happened to the, uh, puppet guy?","You too, sir."
"Oh, 'scuse me. So Ross, uh, how's the wife? Off there too, uh? Uh, Chandler, quick, say something funny!","Dad, dad."
"Gotta go. I miss you too, I love you, but it's getting real late now",
,"Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me? Did you know this isn't Ma?"
Sure. So how long you been...,Her name's Ronni. She's a pet mortician.
Since then?!,"Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships?"
...I d'know.,"No, it's only been six years. I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy. ...Joe. Y'ever been in love?"
You're one to talk.,Then y'haven't. You're burning your tomatoes.
Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.,"Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women."
"It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A. That'd be cool.... This blows!","Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter with you."
What? What?,"I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents? Why do they have to become people? Why do they have... Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?"
"Alright, alright. We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee.",Did you not get a good enough look the other day?
"C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat.","Y'know, I don't see that happening?"
,Well I'm not showing you my 'tat.'
It's Phoebe.,Hello?
C'mon up.,And Rog.
What's the matter with Rog?,"Oh, good. Rog is here."
"Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy.",Yeah.
,"What, so he was a little analytical. That's what he does, y'know? C'mon, he's not that bad."
I dunno. Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail.,"Y'see, that's where you're wrong. Why would I marry her if I thought on any level thatthat she was a lesbian?"
"I don't know. Maybe maybe low self-esteem, maybe maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling, maybe you...",Why? Why would I why? Why? Why? Why?
"Well, I don't know. I mean, it's conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents.","Wait-wait, go back to that sibling thing."
Oh! So you think I'm a failure!,That that's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures!
"Nonono, thatthat's not what I was saying...",Isn't he good?
"Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good!","Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better!"
"You're right! I mean you're right! It wasn't just the Weebles, but it was the Weeble Play Palace, and and the Weebles' Cruise Ship. Oh, which had this little lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in.",
"Oh, okay. Feel better, Rachel, 'kay?","That's tough. Tough stuff. C'mon, Pheebs, we're gonna catch that movie, we gotta get going."
"Oh, okay. Listen, thanks for everything, Mon.","Geez, we're gonna be late, sweetie..."
"Listen guys, it was great seeing you again. Mon, um, easy on those cookies, okay? Remember, they're just food, they're not love.",You're welcome.
Hate that guy!,
,"Night, you guys."
"Hey. Can, uh, can we help you?","Oh look, it's the woman we ordered."
I'm Joey Tribbiani.,"Oh, no thanks, I'm just waiting for, uh, Joey Tribbiani."
"Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?","Oh no, not you, big Joey. Oh my God, you're so much cuter than your pictures! I-I'm, I'm Ronni....Cheese Nip?"
"Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.","Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping. But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose. Like, chasing their tail, or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee."
,That's a good one!
"Dad, Ronni's here.","Hey, Joe."
Hi.,Huh?
"Oh, uh, well, you left your good hair at my apartment, I figured you'd need it tomorrow for your meeting.","Hey! Hello, babe! Wh what're what're you doing here?"
"So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?",Thank you. Uh...
I don't want you taking that thing.,"Look, I uh, I shouldn'ta come. I-I'd better get going, I don't wanna miss the last train."
Who-ah-ho.,"Oh, where'm I gonna stay, here?"
We'll go to a hotel.,We'll go to a hotel.
No we won't.,No you won't.
You're gonna keep an eye on us?,If you go to a hotel you'll be...doing stuff. I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you.
Wow. He's strict.,"That's right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long as you're under my roof you're gonna live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend."
"Thanks. You're, uh, you're a good kid.","Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler's room."
"Okay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta make a change. This has gone on long enough.","C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's not followed by ""No thanks, it's late."""
"Well, either you break it off with Ronni",What kinda change?
Then you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right!,I can't do that!
I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room!,"Yeah, but this is"
Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.,"Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?"
"I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...","Well, you're gonna."
"Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...","Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?"
No.,"Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?"
You really think so?,"No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say ""No thanks, I'm married."""
"Thanks, Chandler.",Yeah. I really do.
Hi.,Get off!
"Yeah, uh, Joey said I could use your shower, since, uh, Chandler's in ours?",Hi...May I help you?
"Oh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rappelano? The mistress?",Okay...who are you?
Thanks.,"Oh, c'mon in."
Hi.,"Hi, I'm Rachel."
Great.,Bathroom's up there.
"Oh, like, uh, five minutes?","Hey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler's been in the shower?"
"Hey. Morning, dear.","Perfect. Fasten your seatbelts, it's peepee time. Hey, Mr. Trib."
Chandler Bing? It's time to see your thing.,
What's the matter with you?!,
What? What?,I thought it was Chandler!
"Sorry, my my thing was in there with me.",You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!
Hey.,"Hey, Pheebs."
Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.,How's it going?
So what's going on?,
"I dunno, there's just something about...","Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger."
We hate that guy.,Basically we just feel that he's...
"We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.",Yeah. Hate him.
"...No, we hate him.","Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?"
Ma! What're you doing here?,We're sorry.
Oww! Big ring!,I came to give you this and this.
"Hold on, you-you knew?","Why did you have to fill your father's head with all that garbage about making things right? Things were fine the way they were! There's chicken in there, put it away. For God's sake, Joey, really."
"So then how could you I mean, how could you?!","Of course I knew! What did you think? Your father is no James Bond. You should've heard some of his cover stories. ""I'm sleeping over at my accountant's,"" I mean, what is that? Please!"
"Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you?","Do you remember how your father used to be? Always yelling, always yelling nothing made him happy, nothing made him happy, not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. Now he's happy! I mean, it's nice, he has a hobby."
I'm...happy...for you?,"Me? I'm fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no her, and your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something else. Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive, he's been more loving... I mean, it's like every day's our anniversary."
"Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want.","Well don't be, because now everything's screwed up. I just want it the way it was."
Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is.,"I know you did, cookie. Oh, I know you did. So tell me. Did you see her?"
With this ring? No contest.,That's sweet. Could I take her?
"Nothing, nothing.","What's wrong, sweetie?"
"It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. They-they have a liking problem with you. In that, um, they don't.","Aaaah, what's wrong, c'mon."
But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see. They don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you're a little...,Oh. They don't.
Intense and creepy.,What?
"But I don't. Me, Phoebe.",Oh.
"You're not? See, that's why you're so great!","Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way."
"So you talked to your dad, huh.","Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me! Define me! Love me, I need love!'."
Wow.,"Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today."
"So Joey, you okay?",Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.
"Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.","Yeah, I guess. It's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go. Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes."
Hey.,"If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom."
How's it going?,"Hey, Pheebs."
Awww.,"Oh, okay, except I broke up with Roger."
Aaawwwwww!!,"Yeah, right."
"I don't know, I mean, he's a good person, and he can be really sweet, and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it's just... I hate that guy!",What happened?
Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green.,"Hey, Joey. What's going on?"
Sorry. Wrong boobies.,Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!
"Hello, Joey.",
"Oh! ...Hello, dear.",
She barely knows me. We just live in the same building.,"I'm tellin' you Ross, she wants you."
She lent me an egg once.,Any contact?
"Aw, right.",You're in!
Hey.,"Hi, Ross."
"Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks.","Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbianI don't think we need a third..."
"Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, ""Here's your egg back, I'm returning your egg.""",An egg?
I think it's insane.,I think it's winning.
,"She'll love it. Go with the egg, my friend."
"No, it's suicide. The man's got an egg.",Think it'll work?
"Do what, do what?",You can not do this.
No! Phoebes! Don't you remember why you dumped the guy?,Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.
"But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do.","'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!"
"Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.","Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?"
"No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.","Oh, uh, listen, about tonight..."
"Pathetic mess? I know, butcome on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching! Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin' this.","Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a..."
"Yes! Way to go, man! Still got the egg, huh?",Hi. She said yes.
"Oh, uh, I... don't... care. Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.",How do I look?
...And what did you bring?,"Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. Very nice."
Janice?,"She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice."
Oh.... my.... God.,
"Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window.","Hey, it's Janice."
Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!,"No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down."
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!","Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous."
Which one was Pete Carney?,"Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney."
"Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over Howard-the-""I-win""-guy. ""I win! I win!"" I went out with the guy for two monthsI didn't get to win once.","Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex. ""Was it good for you?"""
I don't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets.,How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!
"There's more beer, right?",I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch.
"Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald.","Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual."
"Ok, well, what kind of ritual?","Yeah. So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. It's Valentine's Day. It's perfect."
Or?,"Ok. We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us."
Burning's good.,"Or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks."
"You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.","Burning's good. Yeah, I got stuff to burn."
"By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.","Good for you. Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?"
"Oh, are you sure? Really? Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.",That's OK.
We can't do that.,
"Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?",What? What can't you do?
"Uh, we might be leaving now.",
"She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it.","Tell me it's ""you and me"" we."
"You're right, I'm sorry. You're right.","Ok, you can not do this to me."
"I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler.","Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please?"
,I hope she throws up on you.
Just us.,So...
"Although, I have enjoyed the fact that, uh your shirt's been stickin' outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom.","Oh, what a crappy night!"
"So, do we have the best friends or what?",Excuse me. How ya doin'?
I will go for that drink.,Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?
Each.,You got it. Good woman! Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?
Happy Valentine's Day!,"That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy. I've always wanted to know..."
"No... no! And yet it did. Good-bye, Janice.","Oh, I miss you already. Can you believe this happened?"
,Kiss me!
,"Oh, Chandler, sorry."
"Hi, Monica.","Ohhh, Chandler, sorry! Hey, Janice."
"Rach, come see who's out here!","Ok, well, this was very special."
"Oh my god. Janice, hi!",
I'll be right back.,Janice is gonna go away now.
"Oh, Joey, look who it is.",
"Oh, good, Joey's home now.",Whoa.
,This is so fun. This is like a reunion in the hall.
"Hi, Ross. Yes, it's me. How did you know?","Oh, hi, Ross. Yeah. There's someone I want you to say hi to. He just happened to call."
,"I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half."
"The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend.",That's funny. Who are they?
If you wanna put a label on it.,You mean they're lovers.
"Nope, nope, that's it.","Wow, uh, anything else I should know?"
"Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby. I always forget that part. Helloo!",
"All I have is, is oregano and a Fresca.","Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine."
"Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place.","Um, that's ok! Ok. All right. Now we need the semen of a righteous man."
"Ok, yeah, ok. Oh, OK.",Can we just start throwing things in?
"Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah.","Ok, Barry's letters. Adam Ritter's boxer shorts."
Hey he's wearing a sweater.,"Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked."
Eww!,No.
"Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure...",And here we have the last of Paulo's grappa.
How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?,
"Oh, man. In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush.",I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's.
"Hello, funny Valentine.",
"Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker. I could just kiss you all over, and I'm gonna!","Hi, Just Janice."
"If you don't do it, I will.",
"Well, um, for the past few years I've been working.. ...which is funny because, that wasn't even my major.","So, um, what do you do for a living?"
I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry.,Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you.
I guess.,"Now that is funny. Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us? 'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad."
"Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine.",Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?
What do we got there?,"Come on. These people'll scooch down. You guys'll scooch, won't you? Let's try scooching! Come on. Come on. Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. Carol, Kristin. Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade. And, Kristin, Kristin... ...does something that, funnily enough, wasn't even her major!"
"You know, it's a really funny story how this happened.","A piece of something: boxer shorts, greeting cards, and what looks like a half-charred pictureWow, that guy's hairier than the Chief!"
You're our third call tonight.,It's all right. It's all right. You don't have to explain. This isn't the first boyfriend bonfire that we've seen get out of control.
"Oh, sure, Valentine's is our busiest night of the year.",Really?
"Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts. Chan and Jan Forever.",I brought you something.
"Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things are gonna work out.",I had them made special.
It is?,That's fine.
"Oh no, you see, actually it is.",Mmm-hmm. Because I know that this isn't the end.
"Oh, no I don't.","No, it isn't, because you won't let that happen. Don't you know it yet? You love me, Chandler Bing."
"I did, but...",Well then ask yourself this. Why do you think we keep ending up together? New Year's? Who invited who? Valentine's? Who asked who into whose bed?
,"You seek me out. Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn. Janice, Janice. You want me. You need me. You can't live without me. And you know it. You just don't know you know it. See ya."
It's not true. I never called your mother a wolverine.,Call me!
"Uh, I don't think she's in the bathroom. Her coat is gone.","You did so. I swear, I swear How long has she been in the bathroom?"
That could be it.,Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in 9 years.
"Mushroom. Smile. They won't all be like this. Some women might even stay through dinner. Sorry, that's not funny","Oh, god. You know, this is still pretty hot."
,"No, it's just...you know the whole ""getting on with your life"" thing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she's perfectly nice, and, but that there's, that's it. And um, and then I'm here talkin' to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, and, and I don't, I don't have to...You know, here's a wacky thought. Um, what's say you and I give it another shot? No no no, I know what you're gonna say, you're a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for now you know? Let's just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we're great together, you know. You can't deny it. Besides, you're carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that? But see, you know, you keep sayin' that, but there's somethin' right here. I love you."
"No but, no but.","Oh, I love you too. But..."
"That's easy for you to say, you found one already.","You know that thing you put over here with the pin in it? It's time to take the pin out. You'll find someone, I know you will. The right woman is just waiting for you."
,All you need is a woman who likes men and you'll be set.
"We get off around midnight, why don't we pick you up then?",Not her.
I'll even let you ring the bell.,"So, um, will you bring the truck?"
"See, there you go, the cleansing works!","Oh, my god."
"Oh, they're firemen guys.",They're nice guys.
No way!,You guys tell them you were married?
Coffee.,"Are you kidding? My girlfriend doesn't know, I'm not gonna tell them!"
Cappuccino.,Thank you.
And a nice hot cider for Monica.,Grazie.
Yeah?,"Aww, thank you. Uh Rach?"
Oh! That's why. I'm sorry!,Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?
Chandler.,
"Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day.","Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you."
"Hey you guys! Chandler's coming and he says he has, like, this incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know...","Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really. Nothing."
Hey!,
Never mind. But it was going to be really good.,Hey!
What is it?,What's going on?
That's great!,"So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor."
Why?,So.... I quit.
"Yeah, Chandler... you've been there for five years.",Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!
So was it a lot more money?,"If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do."
,It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.
Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.,... the WENUS?
So what're you going to do?,Oh. That WENUS.
"Oooh! I have something you can do! I have this new massage client... Steve? Anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef.",I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there.
"Hi! Oh, yeah, no, I know. You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so....",Um... hi there.
"Yeah, yeah!",Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.
"Well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he's looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu.","Well, what kind of food is he looking for?"
"Yeah, I know! So, what do you think?",Oh my God!
OK. Oh Monica! Guess what!,"Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat."
"No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there.",Can you see my nipples through this shirt?
"Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo. I added the ""a-gogo.""","Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?"
"Hey, you guys all know what you want to do.",Career counselor?
"Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream.",I don't!
,"Ah, the lesser-known ""I don't have a dream"" speech."
Ooh! Brian's Song!,"Oh, I love my life, I love my life!"
"So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this, it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right.",The meeting with the guy went great?
"So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises.",Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?
Yummy noises.,What are you going to make?
I don't know. I don't know. It's just going to be so great!,"And Monica, what are you going to make?"
"Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?","Ooh! I know what you could make! I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the stuff? You know, that thing... with the stuff...? OK, I don't know."
"OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?","How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free."
"Oh, is this the bug lady?",Who are you going out with?
Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady. She's curator of insects at the museum.,"Bzzzz.... I love you, Ross."
"Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey.",So what are you guys going to do?
"So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe... huh-huh?",And he's not speaking metaphorically.
"I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal.","Well, I don't know.... huh-huh.... but I'm hoping huh-huh."
I can't stand this! He's got his claws in my...,"Celia, don't worry! Don't scream! He's not going to hurt you! Soothing tones, Celia. Soothing tones! Marcel..."
"OK, try this salmon mousse.",Alright...
Is it better than the other salmon mousse?,Mmmm. Good.
"Yeah, well, is that better?",It's creamier.
,"I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?"
"Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn? ""You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation.""",My God! What happened to you?
"Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something.",That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!
"Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.","Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!"
It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche.,"Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you."
,Well.... it is amouz-ing...
Ten dollars an hour for what?,"Hello? Oh, hi Wendy! Yeah, eight o'clock. What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?... OK, great. All right, I'll see you then. Bye."
Waitressing?,"Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out."
Well... of course I thought of you! But... but...,Uh-oh.
"But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress.","But, but?"
"You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76. Amouz-bouche?",Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics.
"OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning...",Talk to me.
"Wha... what, here?",No no no. Talk... dirty.
Ah....,Yes...
Er.... um.....,Say something..... hot.
Um... uh.... vulva.,What?
"Alright, I panicked, alright? She took me by surprise. You know, but it wasn't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling.",Vulva?
"Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?",Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times??
Please be kidding.,What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll tell you what. Just try something on me.
OK. I'm in my apartment...,"Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now."
"That's it. I'm in my apartment, you're not there, we're not having this conversation.",....yeah... what else?
"Joey, please.","Alright, look, I'll start, OK?"
Wow.,"Come on. Come on. Alright, ready, look! Oh... Ross.... you get me so hot. I want your lips on me now."
I... ahem... I really don't think so.,"Alright, now you say something."
Yeah.,"Come on! You like this woman, right?"
Sure.,"You want to see her again, right?"
"OK, turn around. I just don't want you staring at me when I'm doing this.","Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her? Now tell me you want to caress my butt!"
"Ahem... I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my lips.","Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead."
"I, er...",There you go! Keep going. Keep going!
I want to take my tongue... and...,
....and....,
...run it all over your body until you're... trembling with... with...,Say it... say it!
....with??,
You're not going to believe this!,Funny story!
"Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again.",It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.
"And again, and again, and again... Hello? And again.",Again?
Well?,"Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth floor? Yeah, I miss you too. Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home, you know? Well, that's very generous er, but look, this isn't about the money. I need something that's more than a job. I need something I can really care about.... And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier? Look, Al, Al... I'm not playing hardball here, OK? This is not a negotiation, this is a rejection! No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy! I'll see you on Monday!"
Look at this!,"Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube."
Yes indeedy! With a beautiful view of...,Oh! You have a window!
"OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down.",Oh look! That guy's peeing!
"This is great! Helen, could you come in here for a moment?",OK.
"Thank you Helen, that'll be all.",
"Last time I do that, I promise.",
Who was that?,"Wendy, we had a deal! Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!"
Oh... that's too bad. Bye bye.,Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.
No.,Ten dollars an hour.
"Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around.",Twelve dollars an hour.
Done.,"You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you. I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... twenty dollars an hour."
Hi Steve!,Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat?
This is Rachel.,"Hello, Monica. Hello, greeter girl."
"Mmmmmm! Everything smells so delicious! You know, I can't remember a time I smelt such a delicious combination of of, OK, smells.","Yeah, OK."
"Oh, thank you. Would you like a tour?",It's a lovely apartment.
,"I was just being polite, but, alright."
"In the cab, on the way over, Steve blazed up a doobie.",What's up?
"Smoked a joint? You know, lit a bone? Weed? Hemp? Ganja?",What?
Is it dry in here?,"OK, OK. I'm with you, Cheech. OK."
"Yeah, I think we're ready for our first course. OK, um, these are rot-shrimp ravioli, and celantro pondou sauce... ... with just a touch of mints... and... ... ginger.","Let me, let me get you some wine!"
I'm so glad you liked them!,"Well, smack my ass and call me Judy! These are fantastic!"
"Oh, well... um, that's all there are of these. But in about eight and a half minutes, we'll be serving some delicious onion tartlets.",Like 'em? I could eat a hundred of them!
Excuse me? Can I help you with anything?,Tartlets. Tartlets. Tartlets. The word has lost all meaning.
,"You know, I don't know what I'm looking for."
You know that? You don't want to spoil your appetite.,"Ah, cool! Taco shells! You know, these are... they're like a little corn envelope."
"You know, if you just wait another... six and a half minutes...",Hey! Sugar-O's!
"No, we don't.",Macaroni and cheese! We gotta make this!
Why don't you just have a seat here? OK... give me the Gummi-bears.,"Oh, OK. Oh, sorry."
Give them to me.,No.
"No, give me the...","Alright, we'll share."
That's it! Dinner is over!,"Well then you can't have any. Bear overboard! I think he's drowning. Hey fellows! Grab on a Sugar-O... save yourself! ""Help! I'm drowning! Help!"""
What?,What?
"Why? It's just that I've waited seven years for an opportunity like this, and you can't even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet?",Why?
Hey!,
You don't want to work for a guy like that.,What a tool!
"I know... it's just... I thought this was, you know... it.",Yeah!
Yeah! You know all those yummy noises? I wasn't faking.,"Look, you'll get there. You're an amazing chef."
"So, er... how did it go with Celia?",
"All right, Ross!","Oh, I was unbelievable."
Whoa! And the... huh-huh?,"I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard. I mean, there were characters, plot lines, themes, a motif... at one point there were villagers."
You cuddled.,"Well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk, it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh..."
You guys wanna try and catch a late movie or something?,"Yeah, which was nice."
"Yeah, where the hell is he?","Maybe, but shouldn't we wait for Chandler?"
How's this?,"Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!... Oh, really, really, really? Well, let me tell you something... you will care about it, because I care about it! You got it? Good! Whooooaaaa...."
Sorry. How about over here?,Eeeee!
"See, that just means it's working. Does this hurt?",Aaaaah!
What about this?,No.
There you go!,Aaaaahhh!!

,"Theres the waitress. Excuse me, Miss. Hello, Miss?"
,Its Phoebe! Hi!
"Wait, wait! Wh-what are you doing here?","Hi. Okay, will that be all?"
"No, no... how come you are working here?","Yeah, um, I was over there, then you said, ""Excuse me, hello Miss,"" so now Im here."
Can we start over?,"Right, yeah, cause its close to where I live, and the aprons are really cute."
"No, no, no!",Yeah. Okay great. Im gonna be over here.
"No, yeah, Ive done that.","I dont know whether hes testing me, or just acting out, but my monkey is out of control. But, he keeps erasing the messages on my machine, ""supposedly"" by accident."
Ive never done that.,"And then, like three days in a row he got to the newspaper before I did, and peed all over the crossword."
"All right, now look at her and tell me she doesnt look exactly like her sister.",
Theyre twins!,Im sayin I see a difference.

"Its mostly just dumb sister stuff, you know, I mean, like, everyone always thought of her as the pretty one, you know... Oh, oh, she was the first one to start walking, even though I did it... later that same day. But, to my parents, by then it was like ""yeah, right, well what else is new?""","Um, Pheebs, so, you guys just dont get along?"
"Oh, and Ive got Earth Science, but I'll catch you in Gym.","Oh, Pheebs, I'm sorry, Ive got to go. Ive got Lamaze class."
"No, Susans gonna be there too. Weve got dads, weve got lesbians, the whole parenting team.","So, is this just gonna be you and Carol?"
"No, no. I mean, it mighta been at first, but by now I, I think I'm pretty comfortable with the whole situation.","Well, isnt, isnt that gonna be weird?"
I know.,"Ross, thats my jacket."
"Hi, were the Rostins. Err, Im J.C., and hes Michael, and were having a boy, and a girl.",
"Hi, um, Im err, Im Ross Geller, and err ah... ..thats, thats my boy in there, and uh, this is Carol Willick, and this... is Susan Bunch. Susan is um Carols, just, com... ..whos next?","Good for you. Alrighty, next?"

Like buddies.,Life partner.

Susan and I live together.,
"Carol, not me.",Although I was married to her.
Its a little complicated.,"Err, right."
But were fine.,A little.
,"Absolutely. So, twins... hah! Thats like two births. Ouch."
Nina Bookbinder is here to see you.,"And to you too, Helen."

"Uh, Yes. Yes. Ive just been going over your data here, and little thing, youve been post-dating your Friday numbers.",You wanted to see me?
"Well, it throws my WENUS out of whack.","Which is bad, because?"
WENUS. Weekly Estimated Net...,Your... excuse me?
,"Oh, Net Usage Statistics, right. Gotcha, gotcha. Wont happen again. I wouldnt want to do anything to hurt your... ""wenus."""
It doesnt matter. You dont dip your pen in the company ink.,"Its not just that shes cute, okay. Its just that... shes really really cute."
"Ross, your little creatures got the remote again.",

"Relax, I'll fix it.",Great.
How did he do this?,"Cool... ""Urkel"" in Spanish is ""Urkel."""
,"So tell me something, is leaving the Christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?"
"Well, someone was supposed to write ""Rach, take down the lights"" and put it on the re... frigerate... How long has that been there?","Ah no, you see, someone was supposed to take them down around New Years... but obviously someone forgot."
"Hey, where you been?",
Score.,"I went back to Riffs. I think Ursula likes me. All I ordered was coffee, she brought me a tuna meltt and four plates of curly fries."
"Yeah, listen. Okay, before you do anything Joey-like, you might wanna run it by err...",She is so hot!
Yeah?,Pheebs?
Why? Why would you wanna... do that? Why?,You think it would be okay if I asked out your sister?
"Well, I mean, I'm not my sisters, you know, whatever, and um... I mean, its true, we were one egg, once, but err, you know, weve grown apart, so, um... I dont know, why not? Okay.","So that if we went out on a date, shed be there."

"Alrighty. Were gonna start with some basic third stage breathing exercises, so Mummies, why dont you get on your back? And... coaches, you should be supporting Mummys head.","Oh, good. Thisll be fun."
What? What? What?,
"Okay, I'm gonna play my sperm card one more time.",I am supposed to be the mommy?
I see. So what do you propose to do?,"Look, I dont see why I should have to miss out on the coaching training just because I'm a woman."
"Flip me for it? No, no, no... heads, heads, heads!",I will flip you for it.
,On your back... Mom.
,"Alright, Mommies, take a nice deep cleansing breath."
,Good. Now imagine your vagina is opening like a flower.
"Ohh, its been better. The Annual Net Usage Statistics are in.","Mr. D, hows it going, sir?"

"Well, were gonna be layin off people in every department.",So what does this mean?
Not you. Relax. Ever have to fire anyone?,"Hey, listen, I know I came in late last week, but I slept funny, and my hair was very very &ndash;"

Would you like to have dinner sometime?,What?
"So Pheebs, what do you want for your birthday?",
Okay... Let me put it this way. Anything from Crabtree and Evelyn?,"Well, what I really want is for my mom to be alive and enjoy it with me."
"Ooh, okay... good.",Ooh! Bath salts would be nice.
What is this place?,
,"Look, youre cold, I have to pee, and... ..theres a cup of coffee on the window. How bad could it be?"
Whats she doing here?,I think we have an answer.
Think she got fired at Riffs?,This could be Gods way of telling us to eat at home.
"Im gonna wait till after we order. Its her, right.","No, no, no. We were there last night. She kept... ..bringing swordfish. are you gonna go to the, um?"
,It looks like her.
Yeah?,"Um, excuse me."
"Right, and its me.","Hi, its us."
Much as you are.,"So, so youre here too?"
Err... we know what we want.,Your turn.
All we want is two Caffe Lattes.,"Oh, thats good."
Good choice.,And some biscottie cookies.
Definitely her.,
,Yeah.
"Well, you still havent taken down the Christmas lights.",I cant believe you. You still havent told that girl she doesnt have a job yet?
"Im just trying to find the right moment, you know?","Congratulations, I think youve found the worlds thinnest argument."
,"Oh, well, that shouldnt be so hard, now that youre dating. ""Sweetheart, youre fired, but how bout a quickie before I go to work?"""
Hey.,Hey.
"You know, once youre inside, you dont have to knock any more.",
,I'll get it.
Youre doing it again.,"Oh. Hi, Mr.Heckles."
I can hear you through the ceiling. My cats cant sleep.,"Were not doing anything. Were just sitting around talking, quietly."
I could have cats.,You dont even have cats.
Well try to keep it down.,Goodbye Mr.Heckles.
"Phoebe, could you do me a favour? Could you try this on? I just wanna make sure it fits.",
"Oh, no no no. Its for Ursula. I just figured, you know, size-wise.","Ooh, my first birthday present... ..oh, this is really..."

Yep. Ice Capades.,Are you seein her again tonight?

,"That you like, we get it. You like her. Great!"
"Alright, well, maybe now its not okay.","Hey, Phoebe, I asked you, and you said it was okay."
Okay.,Okay... Well maybe now I'm not okay with it not being okay.
"Knit, good woman, knit, knit!",
And thats the Chrysler Building right there.,
Mr.Douglas... ..cool tie.,Nina.
Shes still here.,
,"Yes, yes she is. Didnt I memo you on this? See, after I let her go, err, I got a call from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen-nen, Dr. Flanen, Dr. Flan."
Youre kidding? She seems so...,"And err, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly, in fact, he uh, mentioned the word frenzy."
Thats unbelievable.,"Oh, no, no. Nina... ..she is whooo wewee-woo whoo whoo! In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all."
I see. I guess you never really know whats goin on inside a persons head.,"And yet, believable. So I decided not to fire her again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others."
,"Well, I guess thats why they call it psychology, sir."
Lights please? And thats having a baby. Next week is our final class.,"..a sound Mom and Dad never forget. For this after all, is the miracle of birth."
"Susan, go deep.",
This is impossible. Its just impossible.,
"What that woman... did. I am not doin that. Its just gonna have to stay in, thats all, everything will be the same, itll just stay in.","What is, honey?"
"Oh, what do you know? No one's going up to you and saying, ""Hi, is that your nostril? Mind if we push this pot roast through it?""","Carol, honey, shhh, shhh, everythings gonna be alright."
,"Carol, Carol, sweetie. Cleansing breath."
,"I know its frightening, but, big picture. The birth part is just one day, and when its over, were all gonna be parents for the rest of our lives."
Im gonna be a father.,"I mean, thats what this is all about, right? Ross? Ross?"
"I always knew I was havin a baby, I just never realised the baby was having me.",This is just occurring to you?
"Aw, how can you say that? I cant even get Marcel to stop eating the bath mat. How am I gonna raise a kid?","Oh, youre gonna be great!"
,"You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys and babies are actually different."
Out.,Wherere you going?
Yes.,With?
,"Alright, could I just ask you one question?"
"Well, not that its any of your business, but, no, we havent, okay?","Have you two, you know... like... you know... you know... yet?"
"You meant sex, right?",
Do you have a sec?,
"I dont know. For the past couple days, people have been avoiding me and giving me these really strange looks.","Ah, sure, Nina. Whats up?"
Maybe. But that doesnt explain why they keep taking my scissors.,"Oh, well, ah... maybe thats because theyre ah... jealous, of us."
I am?,"Ah, well, maybe thats, ah, because youre getting a big raise."
Oh my god! Youre amazing!,"Sure, why not?"
So you still want me to send her psychological profile to Personnel?,"Oh, you dont know. Helen, could you make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinders raise?"
Helen drinks. Will you marry me?,What?
"Well, I ended up telling her everything.",
"Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing. Little tip: if youre ever in a similar situation, never ever leave your hand... ..on the desk.","Oh, howd she take it?"
,"Okay, I think I get how to do this."

Are you alright?,Okay.
"Okay, Pheebs, can I ask? So, hes going out with her. I mean, is it really so terrible?","Yeah. Its just, you know, its this whole stupid Ursula thing, its..."
No.,"Um, yeah. Look, I mean, Im not saying shes like evil or anything. She just, you know, shes always breaking my stuff. When I was eight, and I wouldnt let her have my Judy Jetson thermos, so she threw it under the bus. And then, oh, and then there was Randy Brown, who was like... Have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend?"
"Oh... Oh, Pheebs.","Well, but thats what he was for me. And she you know, kind of stole him away, and then... broke his heart... and then he wouldnt even talk to me any more. Because he said he didnt wanna be around... anything that looked like either one of us."
Youre not gonna lose him.,"I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but..."
Yeah. Okay.,"Hon, you gotta talk to Joey."
But hes falling in love with her.,"No, come on, he doesnt know this stuff. If he knew how you felt."
Okay... Okay.,"Oh please, theyve been going out a week. They havent even slept together yet, I mean, thats not serious."
"Oh, okay, oh.",
Oh.,
"Yeah, um, may we help you?",
"No no no no no. You wanted me to take them down, so... ..Im takin em down. Okay? Whoa!","Rachel, what are you doing? Its freezing out here. Would you come back inside?"
Oh-my-god Rachel! Rachel!,
"Im okay! Im okay! Mr. Heckles, Mr. Heckles could you help me please?",
Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.,"See, this is just the kind of thing I was talking about."
"Hi. Uh, my friend here was taking down our Christmas lights, and and she fell off the balcony and may have broken her foot or or ankle or something.",
,My god. You still have your Christmas lights up?
,Fill this out and bring it back to me.
,Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow.
You.,"Okay, ooh, alright. Name, address... Okay, in case of emergency, call?"
Yeah.,Really?
"Oh, yeah, check it. Definitely, I want some of that.","Oh, that is so sweet. Oh gosh, love you. Insurance?"
"Why, how much is this gonna cost?",you don't have insurance?
Wel-wel-well what are we gonna do?,"I have no idea, but X-rays alone could be a couple hundred dollars."
"Um... unless, unless I use yours.",Well there's not much we can do.
"well, now, wait a second, who did I just put as my ""In case of emergency"" person?","Hah, no no no no no no no no no no."
"Well, alright, then, forget it. Might as well just go home. Ow ow ow ow!",That's insurance fraud.
Thank you. Thank you. I love you.,"Okay, okay. I hate this."
Why?,"Hi, um, I'm gonna need a new set of these forms ."
You are an idiot. .,"I am really an idiot. you see, I was filling out my friend's form, and instead of putting her information, I put mine."
I had a dream last night where I was playing football with my kid.,"yep, that's me, I am that stupid ."
"No, no, with him. I'm on this field, and they, they hike me the baby... and I, I know I've gotta do something 'cause the Tampa Bay defence is comin' right at me.",That's nice.
"Right, but, it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinkin' they can take us. And so I uh, hah-hah, I just heave it down field.",Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.
He should take the sack?,What are you crazy? That's a baby!
"Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad.","Anyway, suddenly I'm down field, and I realise that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See I, I am so not ready to be a father."
,"Yeah, Ross. You and the baby just need better blocking."
"Well, only if you order stuff.","Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it real expensive?"
Wo-wo-whoa. What about Phoebe's birthday?,I'm takin' Ursula tonight. It's her birthday.
Tonight.,When's that?
,"Oh, man. What're the odds of that happening?"

"Dad, before I was born, did you freak out at all?","I tell you one thing, I wouldn't mind having a piece of this sun-dried tomato business. Five years ago, if somebody had said to me, here's a tomato that looks like a prune, I'd say ""get out of my office!"""
"Dad, dad, dad, I'm talkin' about the whole uh, baby thing. Did you uh, ever get this sort of... panicky, ""Oh my god I'm gonna be a father"" kind of a thing?","I'm not freaking out, I'm just saying, if somebody had come to me with the idea andndash;"
"No, no, Dad, I was just wondering.",No. Your mother really did the work. I was busy with the business. I wasn't around that much. Is that what this is about?
"Thanks, Dad, really, I ju... you know, I just, I just needed to know, um... when did you start to feel like a father?",'Cause there's time to make up for that. We can do stuff together. You always wanted to go to that Colonial Williamsburg. How 'bout we do that?
,"Oh, well, I, I guess it musta been the day after you were born. We were in the hospital room, your mother was asleep, and they brought you in and gave you to me. You were this ugly little red thing, and all of a sudden you grabbed my finger with your whole fist. And you squeezed it, so tight. And that's when I knew."
"No, we can go to Williamsburg.",So you don't wanna go to Williamsburg?
"Rachel, the cute doctors are here.",Eat your fish.
,"Okay, coming!"
Hey.,"Hi, come on in."

"Okay, listen, I'm thinking, why don't we just tell them who we really are? I mean, it'll be fine, I really think it'll be fine.",
"Oh, Monica! Would you stop being such a wuss?",It will not be fine. We'll get in trouble.
,"A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world, okay?"
So... they sss-still seem normal.,So?
"okay, but you have to admit that every time we go out... Women we meet at the hospital... It turns into...",That's because they are.
,"Willya relax? Look around. No pagan altars, no piles of bones in the corners, they're fine. Go like this."
"I am not a baby! You know what? I swear to god, just because you get so uptight every time we...","I said we are not going to do it, okay? Sometimes you can be such a, a big baby."

"Aahh, I'm a... chef at a restaurant uptown.","So, Monica, what do you do?"
"Yeah it is, mostly because I get to boss people around, which I just love to do.",Good for you.
God bless the chickpea.,This hummus is great.
,"Oh, god, I am so spoiled... That's it!"
I used to wet my bed.,"And by the way, have I mentioned that back in high school, I was a cow?"
We both do that!,I use my breasts to get other people's attention.
"Monica and Rachel's apartment. Err yeh, aayah, yeh, just one second... ..ah, Rachel, it's your dad.",
,"Hi, Dad. No, no, it's me. li-listen, Dad, I can't talk right now, um, but there's something, um... there's something that I've been meaning to tell you..."
"Remember back in freshman year? Well, Billy Dreskin and I had sex on your bed.",Would you excuse me for a second?
"Daddy... Daddy... Daddy, why whyyy would I sleep with Billy Dreskin? His father tried to put you out of business! ...dead!",
"Ross, he's got the remote again.",

What?,"Hello, this is Monica... Yeah??? Oh... Okay, yes, we'll be right, we'll be right down. Thank you."
"Ohhh... Okay, you were right. You were right! This was just not worth it.",We forgot to sign one of the admissions forms.
"Okay, let me just change.",Thank you.
,Yes.
Hey!,Hey.
Trouble?,Hi.
"Oh, no. Don't you hate it when people aren't there for you?",Your sister stood me up the other night.
"I've been trying for two days. When I called the restaurant, they said she was too busy to talk. I can't believe she's blowin' me off.",Well did you try calling her?
Hey.,
Oh!,
"Um, yeah, I'm just... ..working.","Um you, you got a minute?"
So.,

You have not changed!,No. No food with a face.
"Yeah, you too.",
"Hi, remember us?",
"Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a whole new one because uh, you see, I-I, I put the wrong name again. 'cause um...",Mmm hmmm.
I am. I'm that stupid.,You're that stupid.
"Well, you know your insurance will cover that.","Yeah, and and, I'm just gonna pay for this with a check."
,"Yeah, I know... ..I'm I'm just not that bright either."
Uh-huh.,"Okay, worst case scenario. Say you never feel like a father."
Do you have a point?,"Say your son never feels connected to you, as one. Say all of his relationships are affected by this."
,"You know, you think I would."
It's just a fur ball.,What's up with the simian?
"Yours, I just got 43 points for 'KIDNEY'.",Okay... ..whose turn is it?

"Well, now, how come you guys have never played poker with us?",And then he did.
"No, women are welcome to play.","Yeah, what is that? Like, some kind of guy thing? Like, some kind of sexist guy thing? Like it's poker, so only guys can play?"
There just don't happen to be any women in our games.,"Oh, OK, so then what is it? Some kind of... you know, like, like... some kind of, y'know, like... alright, what is it?"
"Oh, yeah, right.","Yeah, we just don't happen to know any women that know how to play poker."

"OK, so at this point, the dealer...","Whoa, whoa, whoa, Monica, what're you doin'? This is a poker game. You can't serve food with more than one syllable. It's gotta be like chips, or dip, or pretz..."
"Alright, now, you sure? Phoebe just threw away two jacks because they didn't look happy...","Alright, you know, we got it, we got it. Let's play for real. High stakes... big bucks..."

"OK, sorry to break up this party, but I've got resumes to fax before work tomorrow...",A-ha! And... what is bluffing? Is it not another word for... lying?
"Rach, Rach, we gotta settle.","Whoa, whoa, whoa!"

Oh. Right.,"The game, Rachel, the game. You owe us money for the game."

": So basically, you get your ya-yas by taking money from all of your friends.",Well that's fine with me. Could use the money.
"Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less.",...Yeah.
...Yeah?,"Look, Rachel, this is poker. I play to win, alright? In order for me to win, other people have to lose. So if you're gonna play poker with me, don't expect me to be a 'nice guy,' OK? Cause once those cards are dealt..."
"Alright boys, let's eat.",I'm not a nice guy.
You still on that?,"Oh, did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria?"
"You are way off, pal.","Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? : ""When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy!"""
"Um.... no. See, I might've had feelings for her at one timenot any more. I justI...","No, I don't think so, see Ross, because I think you love her."

"OK, great. You'll tell us and we'll laugh. Let's play poker.","Oh God, oh, and then she told the funniest story..."
"Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don't know... Pictionary?","Alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you don't want to play, we completely understand."
"Ha, ha, very funny, very funny. But I think we'd like to give poker another try. Shall we, ladies?",
"Uh, Rach, do you want me to shuffle those?","Yes, we should. I think we should."
Alright.,"No, no, thats OK. Y'know, I think I'm gonna give it a go."
"So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen big ones.",Alright...
"Alright, here's my $7.50. But I think you should know that this money is cursed.","But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game."
"Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it.",What?
"Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen...","That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break 'em up with a movie."
"You know what? This is not over. We will play you again, and we will win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last dime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever.","Mmm-hmmm. Oh, so typical. Ooo, I'm a man. Ooo, I have a penis. Ooo, I have to win money to exert my power over women."
"So, you gals wanna hand over your money now? That way, we don't have to go through the formality of actually playing.","Hmm. Kinda stepped on my point there, Mon."
"OK, we done with the chit-chat? Are we ready to play some serious poker?","Ooooh, that's fine. We'll see who has the last laugh there, monkey boy."

"I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief.",I can't believe we are even having this discussion.
"I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me.","I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would've happened already?"
"Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part... But she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight.",She really said that?
"Well, I think it's perfect. Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...",'Tonight' tonight?
"Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.",I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.
"Now, now the one in the feather boa, that's Dr. Francis. Now, she used to be a man. Okay, now look, see, there's Raven. We hate her. We're glad she's dying. Okay- Wh- wh- Marcel, are you playing with Monica's shoes? You know you're not supposed to pl- whoah. Marcel, did you poo in the shoe? Marcel, bad monkey! Oh! Oh! Sorry, Barry. Little engagement gift. I'm sure you didn't register for that. Who died? Who died? Roll him over! Oh, c'mon, roll him over! Oh...! Well, we know it wasn't Dexter, right Marcel? Because- Marcel? Marc-","Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used."
How could you lose him?,
Wait. He pooped in my shoe? Which one?,"I don't know. We were watching TV, and then he pooped in Monica's shoe-"
Which ones?,I don't know. The left one.
Hey.,"Oh. Oh, those little clunky Amish things you think go with everything."
"Whoah, ooh, why is the air in here so negative?",Hi.
"Oh no, how?",Rachel lost Marcel.
Which one?,He- he pooped in my shoe.
"No, which one? The right or left? 'Cause the left one is lucky...",Those cute little black ones I wear all the time.
Alright alright. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. Where do you go?,"C'mon, you guys, what're we gonna do, what're we gonna do?"
"Oh, my, God, c'mon, you guys! He's gonna be home any minute! He's gonna kill me!","Okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some of the touristy things. I'll go to Cats, you go to the Russian Tea Room."
"Well, what'm I gonna do? What'm I gonna do?","Okay, we'll start with the building. You guys take the first and second floor, Phoebe and I'll take third and fourth."
,"Okay, you stay here, and just wait by the phone. Spray Lysol in my shoe, and wait for Ross to kill you."
,Anybody wanna trade? Oh...
"Mr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey. Have you seen it?",Whaddyou want?
No!,"I left a Belgian waffle out here, did you take it?"
I wasn't ready for it.,Why would you leave your Belgian waffle in the hall?
Saw Regis Philbin once...,A monkey. Have you seen a monkey?
You owe me a waffle.,"Okay, thank you, Mr. Heckles."
"Okay, he's a, he's a black capuchian monkey with a white face... ...with, with Russian dressing and, and pickles on the side. Okay. Thanks.",
"Great! It went great. Really great. Hey, is that wine?","Hey. How did, uh, how'd it go today?"
"Oh, I would love some. But y'know what? Y'know what? Let's not drink it here. I'm feeling kinda crazy. You wanna go to Newark?","Yeah. You, uh, you want some?"
"Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this.","Uh, okay, yeah, we could do that, but before we head off to the murder capital of the North-East, I was, uh, kinda wanting to run something by you. Y'know how we were, uh, y'know, talking before about, uh, relationships and stuff? Well-"
"Oh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please don't hate me.","Okay, quick and painful."
Y'know Marcel?,"Oh, what? What-what?"
"Well, I kind of... I kind of lost him.",...Yeah?
"I- I- I ca- I can't believe this. I mean, all I asked you to do was keep him in the apartment.",
"No, y'know what, I guess it's partially my fault. Y'know, I shouldn't've, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should've started you off with like a pen or a pencil.","I know, I know, I'm sorry-"
Animal Control.,"Ross, I'm doing everything that I can, I've got everybody looking for him, and I- Oh! Who is it?"
You called Animal Control?,See? I've even called Animal Control!
"Marcel is an illegal exotic animal. I'm not allowed to have him in the city. If they find him, they'll take him away from me.",Uh-huh... why... do you not like them?
"That's right, I.. 'cause I didn't expect you were gonna invite them to the apartment!","O-okay, now see, you never ever ever told us that..."
"Hi, thanks for coming.",
"Oh, y'know what? That was a complete misunderstanding!",Somebody called about a monkey?
Turned out it was a hat.,"Yeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we-we didn't."
Cat! What'm I saying? Cat!,Cat!
"Hi. We checked the third and fourth floor, no-one's seen Marcel.",
My uncle Marcel.,Marcel?
"Oookay. Are you aware that possession of an illegal exotic is, uh, punishable by up to two years in prison and confiscation of the animal?","Oh, is that who the monkey's named after?"
"Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?",Oh my God. You'd put that poor little creature in jail?
"Look. I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this! Um, have a seat. First of all, we haven't been introduced, I'm Monica Geller.","Yes, but there isn't always time!"
Yeah!,"Oh my God, you are! And you're Rachel Green!"
Luisa? Oh my God! Monica! It's Luisa!,Luisa Gianetti! Lincoln High? I sat behind you guys in home room!
Yes!!,The Luisa from home room!
"No, none at all.","You have no idea who I am, do you."
"Well, maybe that's because you spent four years ignoring me. I mean, would it have been so hard to say 'Morning, Luisa'? Or 'Nice overalls'?",None.
"Ah, it's not so much you, you were fat, you had your own problems. But you? What a bitch!","Oh, I'm- I'm so sorry!"
"Be that as it may, d'you think you could just help us out here on that monkey thing? Y'know, just for old times' sake? Go Bobcats?",What?!
Dun-dun-duuuur! Sorry.,"I could... but I won't. If I find that monkey, he's mine."
Marcel?,
Marcel?,Marcel?
,Marcel?
,"Hi, can I help you?"
A monkey.,"Um, we're kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking for something..."
"No. No, haven't seen a monkey. Do you know anything about fixing radiators?",Yes have you seen any?
Of course.,"Um, sure! Did you, uh, did you try turning the knob back the other way?"
,"Oh. Then, no."
,Did I put too much rum in here?
"Oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu.",Just a sec. Hope you find your monkey.
"Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And they're very hot.","Uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?"
,"We can't, alright? We're sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but... We promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out."
Marcel?,"Okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people."
,Marcel?!
Marcel?,Marcel?
Marcel?,Marcel?
Whaaat!,Oh-my-God!
What is it?,Something just brushed up against my right leg!
,"Oh, it's okay, it was just my left leg."
"Yeah! Oh, c'mere, Marcel! Oh, Marcel, c'mere!","Look, Phoebe!"
"Step aside, ladies!",
Just a small tranquiliser.,What're you gonna do?
"Run, Marcel, run! Run, Marcel! Are you okay?",
Oh gosh.,"Yeah, think so. Oh! Huh. Whoah."
Marcel?,
"Marc- oh, this is ridiculous! We've been all over the neighbourhood. He's gone, he's-he's just gone.",Marcel?
"Oh come on. It's cold, it's dark, he doesn't know the Village. And now I have a broken foot. I have no monkey, and a broken foot! Thank you very much.","Ross, you don't know that."
"Yeah, yeah. Y'know, now that you kicked the sign, hey! I don't miss Marcel any more!","Ross, I said I'm sorry like a million times. What do you want me to do? You want me to break my foot too? Okay, I'm gonna break my foot, right here. Ow!! Oh! Oh my God, oh my God! There, are you happy now?!"
"Oh, no no no. Nono, this is just vintage Rachel. I mean, things just sort of happen around you. I mean, you're off in Rachel-land, doing your Rachel-thing, totally oblivious to people's monkeys, or to people's feelings...","Y'know, it is not like I did this on purpose."
"I don't even wanna hear it, you're just...",Ross.
"Oh, forget it, okay?",Ross.
What? What?,Ross!
"Hey! Hey, Bananaman!",
,"Oh, this is so intense. One side of my butt is totally asleep, and the other side has no idea."
What about it?,"Hi, did you order some bananas?"
I don't have a monkey.,Gimme back my monkey.
Potassium.,Then what's with all the bananas?
"Marcel? Marcel? Okay, where is he? Where is he? Marcel? Marcel?",
Marcel! What've you done to him?,
"Are you insane? C'mere, Marcel, c'mon.","That's my monkey. That's Patti, Patti the monkey."
"C'mere, Marcel.","C'mere, Patti."
"Here, monkey. Here, monkey! Here, monkey! Gotcha.","C'mere, Patti."
That's my monkey.,"Okay, gimme my monkey back."
"That's not my monkey. Just the dress is mine, you can send that back whenever.",You're both gonna have to take this up with the judge.
No!,"Alright, I want my monkey."
"Sorry, prom queen.","Oh, c'mon, Luisa!"
"Alright. In high school I was the prom queen and I was the homecoming queen and the class president and you... were also there! But if you take this monkey, I will lose one of the most important people in my life. You can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him. C'mon, Luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here! Take it!","You had to be a bitch in high school, you couldn't've been fat."
"Alright. Well then how about I call your supervisor, and I tell her that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart?",Nope.
"Y'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit.","It'll be nice to get this off finally, won't it? Yes it will. Or we can leave it on for now, that's fine."
"Oh, Ross, c'mon. It's my fault, I almost lost your...","Listen, I'm- I'm sorry I was so hard on you before, it's just I..."
That'd be good.,"Yeah, but you were the one who got him back, y'know? You, you were great. ...Hey, we uh, we still have that, uh, that bottle of wine. You in the mood for, uh, something grape?"
,"Alright. The, uh, the neighbours must be vacuuming. Well, so long as we're here and, uh, not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and, um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um..."
Barry?!,Rachel.
Oh!,"I can't. I can't do it, I can't marry Mindy. I think I'm still in love with you."
This is me in The Sound of Music. See the von Trapp kids?,We have got to start locking that door!
That's because I'm in front of them.,Nope.
"Well, high school was not my favourite time.",Eh. I thought that was an alp.
"Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.","I dunno, I loved high school. Y'know? It was just four years of parties and dating and sex."
Oh. Oooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! My butt cheek is waking up! Oooh! Ooh!,"Gosh, doesn't it seem like a million years ago?"
"No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.",I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr. Peanut than Mr. Salty.
Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!,"I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy."
"Oh, that is so sick.",I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!
"How can people do that?... Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!",I feel violated. And not in a good way.
So have you called her yet?,"I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games..."
"Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.","Let her know I like her? What are you, insane? It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem? I'm right, right?"
"Oh, God, just do it! Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!",I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.
Her answer machine?,"Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat. I got her machine."
"So, uh, why didn't you say anything?","No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up."
"Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!","Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase ""Yes indeedy-o."""
"Okay, they're just talking...","Okay, okay, what's going on?"
"No, no actually, he's smiling.. and... Oh my God, don't do that!!","Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?"
That man across the street just kicked that pigeon! Oh!,What? What? What?!
Oh!... Right!,"And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law."
How'd it go?,Hey Rach!
Not a good day for birds...,"Y'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. He took me to lunch at the Russian Tea Room, and I had that chicken, where y'know you poke it and all the butter squirts out..."
"That's nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?","Then we took a walk down to Bendall's, and I told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of Chanel..."
"That's, that's nice twice!","Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!"
"Duh, where've you been?","Rachel, what's going on? I mean isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar?"
,"Yeah, but it was different with him today! And he wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy, y'know? I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that?"
Why?,Yes!
"Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend?",I have my reasons.
Wow... Wow!,"All right. All right, all right, all right, all right, I know it's stupid! I will go see him this afternoon, and I will just put an end to it!"
"I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that.",Yeah.
"Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here...","Nooo, it wasn't."
That's what you've been working on for the past two hours?!,"Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance. Bye-bye. Oh God!"
What was with the dishes?,"Hey, I've been honing!"
"Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!","Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours."
"Great, now he's waving back.",Oh my God! Go away! Stop looking in here!
What kinda stuff?,"Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!"
You cook naked?,"Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked."
,"Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters."
What's the matter?,What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.
"No, it was. It was very very good.","Oh, it's just... Oh, Barry, this was not good."
"Oh, way, way better than Mindy.","Well, what about Mindy?"
"Well, if you want, I'll justI'll just break it off with her.","No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?"
"Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.","No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me."
"Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..","Thanks, Bernice. Let's go away this weekend."
,"We can, we can go to Aruba! When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice. You would've liked it."
,I had a bra.
,"Hey, Dr. Farber."
,"All right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we're starting to see some real progress here."
"I'm twelve, I'm not stupid.",What?!
Can I use your phone?,
,"Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone."
Maybe she never got your message.,"Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?"
Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...,"Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet."
"Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.","...desperate, needy, pathetic?"
How many beeps?,
"Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about.",She answered.
,"I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy."
How'd he take it?,Hey! Hi!
"Uh, Rach... how come you have dental floss in your hair?","Pretty well, actually..."
Uh huh.,"Oh, do I?"
"You had sex in his chair?!... I said that a little too loudly, didn't I?",We ended up having sex in his chair.
Sex in his chair.,You-you had what?
"I don't know! I mean, we still care about each other. There's a history there. 'S'like you and Carol.","What, uh... what were you thinking?"
"Please. If she said to you, ""Ross, I want you on this couch, right here, right now,"" what would you say?","No! No no, it is nothing like me and Carol!"
"If it helps, I could slide over.",
Where are you going?,"It's, it's, it's, uh, a totally diferent situation! It's, it's apples and oranges, it's, it's orthodontists and lesbi- I gotta go."
,"I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping up with it. Okay?"
,Hello? Hello?
So how's Mindy?,"Hello? Mindy! Hi! Hey, how are you? Yes, yes, I've heard, congratulations, that is so great. Really? Oh. Okay. Okay, well I'm working tomorrow, but if you want you can, you can, you can come by and... Okay... Great... Great... All right, so I'll, so I'll see you tomorrow! Okay.. Okay... Bye. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God."
Brrrrrrr!,"Oh, she wants to see me tomorrow...Oh, she sounded really weird, I gotta call Barry... Hi, it's me, I just.. Mindy!! Mindy! Hi! No, I figured that's where you'd be!"
Hell is filled with people like you.,
,He's back! The peeper's back!
Get down?,Get down!
"Thanks, but I gotta go to work and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy.",...And boogie!
"Please. I haven't heard from her in seven months, and now she calls me? I mean, what else is it about? Oh! She was my best friend, you guys! We went to camp together... she taught me how to kiss..","Relax. Y'know, she may not even know."
"And now, y'know, I'm like... I'm like the other woman! I feel so..",Yeah?
"Right, I'll see you guys later...",..Naughty!
,"Oh, hold up, I'll walk out with you. Now, Rach, when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or- That's fine, yeah..."
Why don't you just take it with you?,"Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?"
Why don't you just call her?,"Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?"
Do you?,"I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride."
Don't you have to pee?,"No! Danielle, hi! It's, uh, it's Chandler! I'm fine. Uh, listen, I don't know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that I am, I accidentally shut off my phone. Oh, uh, okay, that's fine, that's great. Okay. She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back. She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back, she's on the other line, gonna call me back..."
Mindy.,'S'why I'm dancing...
"Hey, you.... So, what's up?","Hey, you."
Sure we should... So.,Um.. we should really be sitting for this.
Okay.,"Now, I know things've been weird lately, but you're like my oldest friend in the world... Except for maybe Laurie Schaffer, who I don't talk to anywhere, 'cause she's all bitter now that she lost the weight and it turns out she doesn't have a pretty face. ....Okay, I'm just gonna ask you this once, and I want a straight answer."
Of course!,Will you be my maid of honour?
Was that all you wanted to ask me?,Oh that's so great!
Ohhhh!! ...What? What?,That's all!
Oh sure it is!,That's not all.
"Um, what- what would make you think that?","Oh no, it isn't! No! I think Barry is seeing someone in the city."
"Really. Mindy, if it'll make you feel any better, when I was engaged to him he went through a whole weird thing too.","Well, ever since we announced the engagement, he's been acting really weird, and then last night, he came home smelling like Chanel."
What? What's what you were afraid of?,"Oh God! You see, that's what I was afraid of!"
What?,"Okay, okay... when Barry was engaged to you, he and I...kind of... had a little thing on the side."
"Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid.","I know. I know, and when he proposed to me, everyone said ""Don't do it, he's just gonna do to you what he did to Rachel,"" and now I feel so stupid."
Smell familiar?,What do you mean?
"Oh, I am so sorry.",Oh no.
,"No me, I am so sorry..."
"Four letters: ""Circle or hoop"".",Oh my.
Thanks.,"Ring dammit, ring!"
What?!,"Hey, you know our phone's not working?"
"I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!","I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer."
"Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?",Just like you told her you did! ... Just pointing out the irony.
"Can I use your phone? Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please.",Nngghhh!!!!!!!
Radiator.,"""Heating device."""
Rdtor.,Five letters.
So she's a woman! So what?,"Yeah, is Sidney there? Oh, this is? Sidney's a woman."
Joey!!,"Yeah. Yeah, so what? Look, I live across the street, and I know all about you and your little telescope, and I don't appreciate it, okay? Yeah, I can see you right now! Hello! If I wanna walk around my apartment in my underwear, I shouldn't have to feel like Thank you, but... that's not really the point... The point is that... Mostly free weights, but occasionally.."
The green dress? Really?,"Yeah, my neighbor... Yeah, the brunette... She says you looked very pretty the other day in the green dress."
Nooo!,"Yeah, she said you looked like Ingrid Bergman that day."
"Sure, sure. Come on... ...in...",Hey. Got a second?
Uh... uh... what're'you... what're'you guys doing here?,"Hello, sweetheart."
Both of you?,"Uh, we are here to break up with you."
"I'm sorry... I'm sorry, God, I am so sorry, I'm an idiot, I was weak, I couldn't help myself! Whatever I did, I only did because I love you so much!","Basically, we think you're a horrible human being, and bad things should happen to you."
"....Mindy. Mindy, of course Mindy, it was always Mindy.","Uh- which one of us are you talking to there, Barr?"
"I swear, whatever I was doing, I was always thinking of you.",Even when we were having sex in that chair?
You did it twice?,Please! During that second time you couldn't have picked her out of a lineup!
Okay...,"Well, the first time didn't really count... I mean, y'know, 's'Barry."
"Dr. Farber, we've got a bit of an emergency here...Jason Costalano is choking on his retainer.","Sweetheart, just gimme- gimme another chance, okay, we'll start all over again. We'll go back to Aruba."
,"Oh God... I'll be right there, Bernice. Look, please, please don't go anywhere, okay? I'll be, I'll be right back."
Yeah... I'm pretty sure I'm still gonna marry him.,"Okay. Okay, we'll be here! Hating you! Did you see how he was sweating when he walked out of there? Listen honey, if I'm hogging the ball too much you just jump right in there and take a couple punches because I'm telling you, this feels great."
"Look, I know he's not perfect, but the truth is, at the end of the day, I still really wanna be Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber, D.D.S.","What are you talking about?! Mindy, the guy is the devil! He's Satan in a smock!"
I hope you can find some way to be happy for me. And I hope you'll still be my maid of honor...?,Oh God.
You okay?,And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba.
Really?,Yeah.
Aww...,"Yeah! Y'know, ever since I ran out on Barry at the wedding, I have wondered whether I made the right choice. And now I know."
Big day.,
You know he's gay?,"All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser. I mean he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat..."
Chandler?,I just wanna clarify this: are you outing Mr. Peanut?
Hi. Hi.,"Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody."
"Well, I've been calling you, but it turns out I had your number wrong. And when I finally got the right one from Information, there was no answer. So I thought I'd just come down here, and make sure you were okay.",What are you doing here?
"Listen uh, maybe we could get together later?","...I'm, I'm okay."
You got it.,"That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever..."
"G'bye, everybody.",Okay.
Whoo-hoo!,Bye.
Second date!,"Yeah, there you go!"
You don't know?!,...I dunno.
,"Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that?"
I have no idea. But look how much they spent!,How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?
I know. It's just such reckless spending.,"Monica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought."
"Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.","I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind."
"Oh! The yuk! Ross, he's doing it again!",That's me.
"Oh no, not in my room! I'll get him.","Marcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel, come back- come here, Marcel-"
"What? It's, it's just a phase.","Ross, you've got to do something about the humping."
Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal.,"Well, that's what we said about Joey..."
What?,Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!
"Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.",Let's just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious.
What?,This woman's living my life.
You're not an artist.,"She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies."
"Oh, Monica, c'mon, you do cool things.","Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't."
"Oh, it's so late for 'Shall we'...","Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we."
Nooo...,Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School?
How about Joey... Pepponi?,"This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother."
Joey... Switzerland?,"No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral."
"Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big. Which I'm not.",
Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.,Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?
"Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good.","Well, it does not ring a bell with me..."
,Might wanna try Joseph.
"Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.",Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!
Hey.,Hey.
What are you doing?,"Hi. Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I believe I'm taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were."
"What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?","Alright, great. Thanks a lot. I'm going to tap class."
"Go to the post office! I'm sure her picture's up! ...Okay, Monica, y'know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing.","This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is."
What d'you think?,"This is madness. It's madness, I tell you, for the love of God, Monica, don't do it!! ...Thank you."
,Lotsa things.
,Which one do you think she is?
"Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe.",May I help you?
What does she mean?,You don't observe a dance class. You dance a dance class. Spare shoes are over there.
"Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?","I think she means 'You dance a dance class'. Oh, c'mon, c'mon."
She could be you.,People! Last time there were some empty yoghurt containers lying around after class. Let's not have that happen again!
"Let's get started. Five, six, a-five six seven eight...",
"Okay, I'm not getting this!",
Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?,I'm totally getting it!
What? You just click when they click.,
,"Alright people, now everyone grab a partner."
Great. It's gym class all over again.,"Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel."
"Well that's all right, you can come up to the front and dance with me.",Aww.
,Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare.
She's your partner.,"It's okay, it's okay, I'm here, I'm here. Sorry I'm late, okay, here I am. Who's the new tense girl?"
Oh. Monica! ...Hi. I'm Mo- ...nana.,Hi. I'm Monica.
Yeah. It's Dutch.,Monana?
"Um, Pennsylvania Dutch.",You're kidding! I-I spent three years in Amsterdam.
Hi.,"And we're dancing. A-five, six, seven, eight..."
Where've you been?,Hey.
"She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?",At the vet.
Hey! He beat ya.,She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.
So what does this mean?,"She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent."
"I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!",I'm gonna have to give him up.
"I know. I know. I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you know it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg.","I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?"
"No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo.",Isn't there any way you can keep him?
"I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.",How do you get a monkey into a zoo?
"Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a total party zoo.","Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility."
"Hey. We found her, we found the girl.",
Did you call the cops?,What?
Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.,Nope. We took her to lunch.
"Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit.",What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a stealer.
...Take off their hats!,"Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader."
No way. No way did you do this.,Popes in a Volkswagen! ...I love that joke.
It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!,Monana was very brave.
...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!,"So once they caught on to the fact that we're, y'know, short and have breasts..."
"Oh, by the way, tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show.","Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up."
"There's an open call for Cats. I'm thinking we go down there, sing Memories and make complete fools of ourselves. Whaddya say?",'Scuse me?
"Well, that's just probably 'cause of your Amish background.","Nononononono. Think who you're dealing with here. I mean, I'm not like you. I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class."
"Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?",What?
I-I used to be just like you. And then one day I saw a movie that changed my life. Did you ever see Dead Poets' Society?,"Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned."
"I thought that movie was so incredibly... boring. I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play? What was that?! It's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. I walked out of there and I thought, 'Now, that's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back.' And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do.",Uh-huh.
"Oh God. We didn't get into Scranton. That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I don't know who this is harder on, me or him.",Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.
"Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?",I'd say that chair's taking the brunt.
You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?,"Oh, somebody will."
Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that!,You're kidding.
Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?,"Y'know, you'd think I would've."
Where exactly is your zoo?,...Flame Boy.
Yes.,"Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience. Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?"
"No-no, he's, he's very docile.","Does he, uh, fight with other animals?"
"Well I, I don't know. Why?",Even if he were... cornered?
"He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...","Uh, how is he at handling small objects?"
Why- why- why would he need a blade?,"How about a hammer, or a small blade?"
,"Well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you've got to give the little guy something. Otherwise it's just cruel."
"We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...","He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego."
"He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!",...He's in.
Yo- hooo!,"You're making a big mistake here. I mean, San Diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains."
Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.,Where the hell've you been?
Noooo! I'm lying. I am so drunk.,Are you drunk?!
,"Oh God, oh. Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried..."
Water rules!,Monica? Monica!
Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today.,"Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you're gonna be showing up for work?"
"No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!","Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!"
"Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the credit card people.",
What?,Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.
Hi.,They've arrested Monica.
How are you?,Hey.
Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.,"I'm not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my colour. How-how did you know I was here?"
"I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in.",That I was not expecting.
"No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden Theater!",Oh. Thanks.
"I just can't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without you? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus?","Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'."
"Well, not... worried, just... wondering.","Monica, I started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other women, and you're worried about who's gonna take you to the Big Apple Circus?"
Not necessarily...,"There's nothing to wonder about, Monica. You're gonna go back to being exactly who you were, because that's who you are."
"Um, I'm not actually Amish.","Yes necessarily! I mean, I dunno what it is, maybe it's the Amish thing."
You by the door. In or out?,Really? Then why are you like that?
"You in the back, you're getting it all wrong!",In.
"This is the final boarding call for flight 67 to San Diego, boarding at gate 42A.","Yeah, but at least I'm doing it!"
"Aww. Thank you, Aunt Phoebe.","Okay. Good-bye, little monkey guy. Alright, I wrote you this poem. Okay, but don't eat it 'till you get on the plane."
"Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there's gonna be a lot of babes in San Diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn.",Oh!
"Just, just say what you feel.","I dunno what to say, Ross. Uh, it's a monkey."
That was good.,"Marcel, I'm hungry."
"Uh, if you guys don't mind, I'd like to take a moment, just me and him.","Marcel, this is for you. It's, uh, just, y'know, something to, um, do on the plane."
"Marcel, c'mere, c'mere. Well buddy, this is it. There's just a coupla things I want to say. I'm really gonna miss you, and I'm never gonna forget about you. You've been more than just a pet to me, you've been more like a be- Okay, Marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? Could you just stop humping me for two seconds?! Marcel, would- okay, just take him away. Just take him.","Oh, sure. Sure, absolutely."
"Oh, that I were a glove upon that hand, that I might... touch thy cheek...",
Next.,"That's fine, thank you."
Name?,"Hi, uh, I'll be reading for the role of Mercutio."
Tell him.,Holden McGroin.
"Tell him, tell him.",No.
Shut up!,Just...please tell him.
"Look at you, you won't even look at him.",Tell me what?
"All right, all right, all right. Last night, I had a dream that, uh, you and I, were...","Oh, come on tell me. I could use another reason why women won't look at me."
Wow!,Doing it on this table.
"Why, why, why would you dream that?",Exellent dream score.
"Well, you were pretty damn good.","More importantly, was I any good?"
"Well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table.","Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate."
,"I love it, when we share."
I can't belive you two had sex in her dream.,You're okay there?
Hello Rachel.,"I'm sorry, it was a one-time-thing. I was very drunk and i was somebody else's subconscious."
"Uh, uh, gimme. Can you see me operating a drill press?",Get off.
,I don't know. What are you wearing?
"Just for some short-term-work. You know, until I get back some of my massage clients.","Pheebs, why would you want to operate a drill press?"
"No, nothing like that. I was just...such a dummie. I taught this ""massage-yourself-at-home-workshop."" And they are.",Pirates again?
"Thanks Joey, that's a good idea.","Hey, hey, Chan. She could work for you."
"Well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. She is having one of her boobs redused. It's a whole big boob story.","What... I could, I could do it. What is it?"
"Well, you know Phoebs. I don't know if it's your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day.",I could be a secretary.
,I could do that.
"Oh, it's my new beeper.",What are you playing with?
"Is it like for dinosaur emergencies. 'Help, come quick, they're still extinct.'",What the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for?
"A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid.","No, it's for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO."
Off to see young Ethan?,"All right, I'll see you guys later."
How young is young Ethan? Young?,Thank you.
When we were?,He's... our age.
College?,"Okay, he's a senior in college."
"No, of course not. It's not even an issue. Cause I told him I was 22.",Whoa! And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?
"Oh, I can't pass for 22?",What?
I am 26.,"Well, maybe 25-26."
Can you hear that?,There you go.
See that'll stop when you pick up the phone.,Yeah?
"Mr. Bing's office. No I'm sorry, he's in a meeting right now.","Oh. Uh, I'm on."
"Will he know what this is in reference to? And he has your number? All right, I'll see that he gets the message. Bye bye.",I'm not in a meeting. I'm right... Whoops.
Ross says hi.,What?
"This is so fun. All right, what do we do now?",Ah!
"Most likely. Okay, I'm gonna be out there.","Well, now, I actually have to get to work."
All right. Bye bye.,Okay.
,Bye bye.
Whatcha doin'?,Yes?
"Windows are clean, candels are lit. Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt. Did I turn the fish? No, cause I made lasagne. Am I out of control?",Ooh.
What?,"Just a touch. Mon, I don't understand. I mean, you've been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms? I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh."
"I don't know. Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... you know. Things happen, and they happen. You don't plan these things.",Could tonight be the Night?
Yeah.,"So, did you shave your legs?"
Would you let it go Ross. It was just a dream. It doesn't mean...,A-ha!
"Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh this is it. Oh my god it's baby time. Baby time.",
,"All right, relax, relax. Just relax, just relax. Be cool, be cool."
"Services? Oh, services.","Yeah, hi, I was just beeped. No, Andr is not here. Third time today. Yes, I'm sure... No, sir. I don't perform those kind of services."
,"Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO. Yeah, that's right. That's right, JUMBO with a U, sir. No, belive me, you don't want me. Judging by his number, I'd be a huge disappointment. All rightie, bye bye."
"Oh, exellent. Everyone was so, so nice.","Hey, hey. How was the first day?"
"No, I didn't tell anybody that I knew you.","See, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes. Me."
"Oh, because, you know... they don't like you.",Why not?
I thought you knew that.,What?!
Everyone. Except for uh... no everyone.,Noho. Who doesn't they like me?
"Don't feel bad. You know they used to like you a lot. But then you got promoted, and, you know, now you're like ""Mr. Boss Man"". You know, Mr. Bing. Mr. Bing, ""Boss Man Bing"".",What are you talking about?
I can't belive it.,
They do me?,"Yeah, yeah. They even do you."
,You know like... uh okay... uh... 'Could that report be any later?'
"Oh, oh Chandler...",I don't sound like that.
'The hills were alive with the sound of music.',"Oh... Yeah, you do."
My scones.,
,'My scones.'
,"Okay, I don't sound like that. That is so not true."
,"That is so not... That is so not... That... Oh, shut up!"
"I am telling you, up until I was, like nine, I thought that gunpoint was an actual place where crimes happen.",Did not.
"Well, think about it. It's always on the news. 'A man is being held up, at gunpoint.' 'Tourists are being terrorised, at gunpoint.' And I just kept thinking: why does people continue to go there? Oh, ah. I should go.",How was that possible?
,Okay.
Unless...,Okay.
"Uh, ah. Unless you wanna stay over? I mean, I'm going to, so...",What?
,"Yeah, I'd really like that."
"Okay, is this like 'I have an early class tomorrow' or 'I'm secretly married to a goat?'","Uuh, before we get into any staying-over-stuff, there is something you should know."
Ethan?,"Well it's somewhere in between. You see, in a strictly technical sense, of course, I'm not uh..., well I, I mean I haven't ever uh..."
Are you a virgin?,Yeah?
Really?,"Well, if that's what you kids are calling it these days then, yes I am. I uh, I've kinda been waiting for the right person."
,"Yeah. You do know I was talking about you, right?"
Wow!,
"You know, you read about it, you see it in the movies. Even when you practice it at home, man oh man, it is nothing like that.",You keep saying that.
"Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. And I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to.",
No-no. Nothing wrong about that.,"Oh god, don't tell me, I did it wrong."
"Um, okay, here it goes. I'm not 22. I'm, I'm 25... and thirteen months.",Oh.
"But I figured, you know, that shouldn't change anything. I mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are.",Huh!
"Uh, listen um, as long as we're telling stuff, uh, I have another one for you. I'm a little younger than I said.",
"Oh, I'm a senior... in High School.",You're not a senior?
"What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn't alive during the Bicentennial.",Ok...ay.
"Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?",I just had sex.
"Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?","Well, you never told me how old you were."
Don't say it.,I wasn't thinking. I was too busy fallin'...
Really?,...in love with you.
"Well,fall out of it. You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school night. Oh god, oh god. I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad. I'm Joan Collins.",Sorry.
"Okay, Andr should be there in like 45 minutes. All rightie, bye bye. Just easier that way.",Who?
"No, forget it.","Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream."
"All right, fine. Um, you were not the only one there. Joey was there too.","Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy?"
"Was there...uh, huh, huh, huh... andybody, anybody else there.",All right.
"You're sure? Nobody uh, handed out uh, mints or anything?",No.
Huh!,"No, it was just the three of us."
You know what?,"So, tell me. Was it like you and Chandler, and then you and me, or you and me and Chandler?"
There were times when it wasn't even me.,What?
"That is so sweet, you guys.",
"Hey, Mon.",
Mon!,"Mon, Ethan called again. Mon?"
What?,
Oh.,Ethan called again.
"No. You know, sometimes just things doesn't work out.",Are you not seeing him anymore?
,And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym.
"Listen, the next time you talk to him, can you ask him which one the strongest Power Ranger is?","I, I didn't say any... I sw... I did not say anything, I swear. He stopped by."
"Oh, yeah.",
Sorry.,"Ha,ha, ha, oh my life is just so amusing. Could we drop it now?"
Stegosaurus!,It's morphin time!
,Tyrannosaurus!
Where are you going?,"Ooh, oh, I've gotta go. Whoa, oh, head rush. One more, and then I have to go. Cool!"
Work people? Nobody told me.,"Um, oh, I've got a birthday party, with some work people."
"You know, I don't get this. A month ago, these people were my friends. You know, just because I'm in charge doesn't mean I'm a different person.","No, I know. That's a part of the whole, you know, them-not-liking-you-extravaganza."
You think I should?,"Well, then you should come tonight. You know, just hang out with them. Let them see what a great guy you still are."
Okay.,"I really do, yeah."
Okay.,Okay.
"I Think last night was great. You know, the Karaoke thing. Tracy and I doing Ebony and Ivory.","Oh, but, could we not go together? I,I don't wanna be the geek that invited the boss."
What?,You were great. But they still made fun of you.
"Then, I don't get it.","You know, now you're more like, you know like, ""Mr. Caring Boss,"" ""Mr."", you know, ""I'm one of you, Boss,"" ""Mr., I wanna be your buddy, Boss Man Bing!"""
They do?,"Well, you know what Chandler? I think you've gotta face it. You're like, the guy in the big office, you know. You're the one that hires them, that fires them... They still say you're a great boss."
I just wan't to...,Uh huh. But they're not your friends anymore.
But I just wa...,"No, but you can't."
Aren't you gonna...,Uh uh.
What about Andre?,"Oh, Carol and I have a new system. If she punches in 911, it means she's having a baby, otherwise I just ignore it."
,"Oh, well this morning he got a call from who I think was our cousin Nathan, and frankly, it was a little more than I needed to know."
That was gonna be my opener.,Hey.
I thought that was just a rumour.,"Hey, did you guys check out those new hand-dryers in the bathroom?"
They're here already?,True story.
"All right, look. I've gotta tell you something. I'm not 17. I only said so that you'd think I was cute and vunerable. I'm actually 30, I have a wife, I have a job, I'm your Congressman. Monica, this is ridiculous, we're great together. We can talk, we make each other laugh, and the sex. Oh, man, okay i have no frame of graft, but I thought that was great.",
"Then, what's the problem?",It was.
Icky? You're actually gonna throw this away because it's icky?,"Ethan, it's um... it's icky."
"No, don't say it.","This isn't easy for me either. I wish things were different, I... If you were a few years older, or if I was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times, I would really..."
,...love you.
"Uh, moist, yeah.",Are you're hands still wet?
,Let's dry 'em again.
"Hello, Mr. Bing.","Uh, like, could these margaritas be any stronger? Hey, Chandler."
"Thanks. Listen, about the weekly numbers, I'm gonna need them on my desk by nine o'clock.",Loved your Stevie Wonder last night.
No problem.,Sure.
"You have to give 'em something, you know. Okay, now that was Gerston, Santos, and who's the guy with the moustache?",
"Petrie, right, right. Okay, some people gonna be working this weekend.",Petrie.
,"Oooooooooh. Oh, that's nice. Oh, oh. Huh, Ross!"
I'm here.,Ross?
"What? Great, now I'm having a baby.","You are. Well, um... We, we, we were just... Wow!"
"Ooh, Ooh.",What?
I'm having... I'm having a baby. I'm having a... Where's the phone? The phone?,What?
,I don't know where the phone is.
I'm hurt.,Ross?
,"Monica, let's go. Come on now people, woman in labor."
"Yeah, save it for the cab, okay.","Hey Ross, look what I've got going here."
What are you doing? We're going to a hospital.,
"Joey, get out of the fridge.","What, so I can't lokk nice? There might be doctors there."
What is that?,"All right, all right."
"Yeah, like in a cab...",For the ride.
"Okay, hating this.",Save it.
,"Monica, come on now. Let's go, baby coming."
"That's nice. Get out Let's go, come on.","I can't belive it, I'm gonna be an aunt. I'm gonna have like a nephew."
,"All right, I'm going. I'm going."
"Rossy, Rossy.","Here we go, here we go."
I'm sure everything's fine. Has her water broke yet?,She's not here yet. She's not here. She's having my baby and she's not here.
,"I don't know, but when I spoke to her, she said she had already passed the mucus plug."
"Joey, what are you gonna do when you have a baby?",Do we have to know about that?
"Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50's.","I'm gonna be in the waitin' room, handing out cigars."
"Oh, Ross, relax. It's probably like two dollars for the first contraction, and then fifty cents for each additional contraction.","God, I don't believe this. She could be giving birth in the cab."
"What, it's ok when Chandler does it?",
,You have to pick your moments.
She's not even here yet.,"Did I miss it, did I miss it?"
"I just thought we might be here for awhile. You know, things might get musical.",What's with the guitar?
Where the hell have you been?,
"I was looking at stuffed animals, and Susan wanted a Chunky.",We stopped at the gift shop.
I used to have that bumper sticker.,"Susan wanted a Chunky. We're having a baby, ok, a baby, you don't stop for Chunkys."
You see what I mean.,
"Let it go, Ross.",Stopped for a Chunky.
No.,I got an extra one. You want this?
"Hey, how's my favorite parenting team doing?",
"So, I understand you're thinking of having a baby? Well, I see you're nine months pregnant. That's a good start. How you doing with your contractions?","Dr. Franzblau, hi."
They're every four minutes and last 55 seconds.,"Oh, I love them. Each one's like a little party in my uterus."
"Swiss quartz, ha, ha.","59 seconds. Quartz, ha."
"Ice chips, just ice chips. They're at the nurses' station.",Am I allowed to drink anything?
"No, I'm getting it. I'll be right back.",I'll get it.
,I got itI'm getting it!
Thanks.,"Hi, I thought you might like some ice chips."
It is nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Franzblau. I'm your roommate's... brother's... ex-wife's obstetrician.,"And if you need anything else, I do not believe we've met. Hi. I'm, uh, Rachel Green. I'm Carol's... ex-husband's... sister's roommate."
I want a baby.,"Oh, that's funny!"
Get up. Come on. Let's get some coffee.,"Mmmm. Not tonight, honey. I got an early day tomorrow."
,"Oh, ok, 'cause we never do that."
,"Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot, or just fall down. That's good too."
"Oh, yeah.",Knick fan?
"Hey, listen, lady.... ...whoa.","Oh, boy, do they suck."
Oh yeah? And who do you like?,"Look, look at your man, Ewing. Nice shot. You know what, he couldn't hit water if he was standing on a boat."
"The Celtics? Ha. They couldn't hit a boat if...wait. They suck, alright?",The Celtics.
"Wha? Wha..aa? Let me get the father. Hey, we need a father over here! We need a father!","Oh, shut up. You know, it's a rebuilding year. You... waah!"
"Oh, oh, oh, sorry.",There is no father.
"Oh, uh, ok. Right this way. All the other pregnant women seem to be goin' in here.","Ok, that's ok. I'm fine. I'm... oh!"
,Ok.
"They're tiny and chubby and so sweet to touch, and soon they'll grow up and resent you so much. Now they're yelling at you and you don't know why, you cry and you cry and you cry. And you cry and you cry and you cry...",
"Thanks, Ross.",
Ok.,Yeah. I'm paying you to stop.
"Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.",
You'll get one.,No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
"All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?",Oh yeah? When?
"Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.",Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
"No, no, no.","Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?"
"Uh, uh.",What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack!,Well?
Hey.,
Did you go home and change?,"Hey. Ooh, look at you, dressy-dress."
"No, I haven't seen him.","Yeah, well, it's an important day. I wanna look nice. Um, has uh Dr. Franzblau been by?"
"Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your father a doctor?","Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here. What if the baby needs him?"
No reason.,"Yeah, why?"
Tribbiani.,"Mom, we've been through this. No, I'm not calling him. I don't care if it is his kid, the guy's a jerk. No, I'm not alone. Joey's here. What do you mean, Joey who? Joey who?"
"Hi, yeah, it's me. Oh, no no no, we're just friends. Yeah, I'm single. 25. An actor. Hello?","Joey Tribbiani. Yes, ok. Hold on. She wants to talk to you. Take the phone."
"Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?",She's not much of a phone person.
"Ok, look, maybe I should just go.","Hey, Knick fan, am I interested in your views on fatherhood? Uh, no."
"Good luck, and uh, take care, huh?",Maybe you should.
You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team.,
"Oh, it is.","Oh, that is so not true."
It is.,It isn't.
Breathe.,Isn't!
Breathe.,Breathe.
Breathe.,Breathe.
You're gonna kill me!,Breathe.
Count faster.,"15 more seconds, 14, 13, 12..."
Who the hell is Jordie?,"It's gonna be ok, just remember, we're doing this for Jordie. Just keep focusing on Jordie."
"No-no-no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie.",Your son.
"What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean, back to Jordie? We never landed on Jordie. We just passed by it during the whole Jessy, Cody, Dylan fiasco.","Well, Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend, so we went back to Jordie."
I got it.,"Ow, ow, ow, ow, leg cramp, leg cramp, leg cramp."
"I got it! Hey, you get to sleep with her, I get the cramps.",I got it.
"All right, that's it. I want both of you out.","No, you don't."
He started it!,Why?
You did!,"No, you started it."
But...,"I don't care. I am trying to get a person out of my body here, and you're not making it any easier."
Thanks a lot.,Now go!
"Yeah, listen...",See what you did.
,Out!
"Oh, no.","Breathe, breathe, breathe..."
Ew! What is that? Something exploded!,
"Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking?","It's just her water breaking. Calm down, will you?"
Please. This is so your fault.,"Breathe, breathe, breathe."
"Look, Carol never threw me out of a room before you came along.","How, how is this my fault?"
You tryin' to be clever? A funny lady?,"Yeah? Well, there's a lot of things Carol never did before I came along."
"Oh, I'm threatened by you?",You know what your problem is? You're threatened by me.
,Yes.
"Yeah, Susan.","Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it! Get in here. Come on. My god, you guys, I don't believe you. There are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing. So just stop all the yelling, just stop it!"
,"Don't make me do this again, I don't like my voice like this."
Help!,"Ok, who wants to hear something ironic?"
Are they here yet?,"I'm having a baby in here! Ok, everyone stand back. Ow."
Ok.,"No, honey, they're not, but don't worry, because we are going to find them, and until we do, we are all here for you, ok?"
Ok.,Ok?
"It really was. There was this great little pastry shop right by my hotel. There you go, dear.","Ok, so anyway, you were telling me about Paris, it sounds fascinating."
"What're you gonna do, suck the door open?","Come on, Lydia, you can do it. Push! Push 'em out, push 'em out, harder, harder. Push 'em out, push 'em out, way out! Let's get that ball and really move, hey, hey, ho, ho. Let's I was justyeah, right. Push! Push!"
"They found their bodies the very next day, they found their bodies the very next... la la la la la la.",Help! Help!
"Now, Mom, everything's going fine, really. Yeah, Ross is great. He's uh, he's in a whole other place. No, he's gone. No no, you don't have to fly back, really. What do you mean this might be your only chance? Would you stop? I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet.",Help!
Where have you been?,
Mazel tov!,"Oh, just had a baby."
"No, no, not at the moment, no, I'm not. Are you?","I don't know, could be an hour, could be three, but relax, she's doing great. So, uh, tell me, are you currently involved with anyone?"
"Right, yeah, I've heard that about cute doctors.","No, it's hard enough to get women to go out with me."
Oh.,"No, no, really. I suppose it's because I spend so much time, you know, where I do."
I'm a waitress.,"I try not to let my work affect my personal life, but it's hard, when you... do what I do. It's like uh...Well, for instance, what do you do?"
Yeah. Gotcha.,"Ok, all right, well aren't there times when you come home at the end of the day, and you're just like, 'if I see one more cup of coffee'..."
Ok. That's fine.,I'm gonna go check up on your friend.
Your mom called me. So is this her?,So how did you know I was even here?
I'm sorry you had to do this by yourself.,"No, this is a loaner."
"Yeah, the Knicks by 10. They suck.","I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor, a nurse, and a helper guy. So, did you see who won the game?"
,"Yeah, they're not so bad."
The woman I love is having a baby today. I've been waiting for this just as much as you have.,"Come on, come on. Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit. This is all your fault. This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know? My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you."
"You get to be the baby's father. Everyone knows who you are. Who am I? There's Mother's Day, there's Father's Day, there's no... Lesbian Lover Day.","No no no, believe me. No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok? And you know what the funny thing is? When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok? Where does that leave me?"
This is so great.,Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.
"I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one. And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most. And it's not even born yet. It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world. I'm sorry, you were fighting.",You wanna explain that?
I'm sure they'll be here soon.,Where are they?
Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.,"Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this."
,You are really frightening me.
"All right, ten centimeters, here we go.","Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart. Uh, that's great. Anybody seen a nipple?"
But they're not here yet!,"All right, honey, time to start pushing."
"Oh, god.","I'm sorry, I can't tell the baby to wait for them."
"Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue!","Ok, got the vent open."
,"Ben, you ready? All right, gimme your foot. Ok, on three, Ben. One, two, three. Ok, That's it, Ben."
"Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in fact a dark vent.",What do you see?
"Phoebs, It's open! It's open!",
Wait! You forgot your legs!,
We're here!,"Push, push!"
"Long story, honey.",Where have you been?
"All right, all right, there's a few too many people in this room, and there's about to be one more, so anybody who's not an ex-husband or a lesbian life partner, out you go!","All right, Carol, I need you to keep pushing. I need Excuse me, could I have this?"
,Good luck!
Out!,"Let me ask you, do you have to be Carol's lesbian life partner?"
"Let me see, I gotta see, I gotta see. Oh, a head. Oh, it's, it's huge. Carol, how are you doing this?","All right, he's crowning. Here he comes."
"You're doing great, you're doing fine.",Not.... helping!
What do you see? What do you see?,"Hello! Oh, sorry."
"Oh, look at that.","We got a head, we got shoulders, we got arms, we got, oh, look at the little fingers, oh, and a chest, and a stomach. It's a boy, definitely a boy! All right! Ok, legs, knees, and feet. Oh, oh. He's here. He's a person."
"Kinda like my uncle Ed, covered in Jell-o.",What does he look like?
"You guys, he's beautiful!",Really?
,"Oh, thanks, Pheebs!"
How 'bout Ben?,"No shouting, but we still need a name for this little guy."
Ben. Ben. Ben's good. How come you never mentioned Ben before?,I like Ben.
That's what we were off doing.,"We uh, we just cooked it up."
Hi.,
Can we come in?,Hey.
"I know, I know. Everybody, there's someone I'd like you to meet. Yeah. This is Ben. Ben, this is everybody.",
Thanks.,"Susan, he looks just like you."
"I know, I still am one of these.","Oh, god, I can't believe one of us actually has one of these."
,"Ross, can I?"
"Hi, Ben. Hi. I'm your Aunt Monica. Yes I am. I'm your Aunt Monica. I...I will always have gum.","The head, the head. You gotta..."
,"Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this. But I'll still always come back, like this. And sometimes I may be away longer, like this. But I'll still always come back, like this."
,"And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third, and I'll go like this."
"Oh, I know. Look at him.",He is so amazing.
"Oh, look, look, he's closing his eyes. Look, he's opening his eyes.","Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I don't think that's his name."
"No, this is pretty much it.","He doesn't do much, does he?"
You guys wanna get some coffee?,
"All right, I'll see you guys later.",Yeah.
"Oh, look, he's closing his eyes again.",
And here's little Ben nodding off...,
"Oh, look, he's got Ross's haircut!","Awww, look at Aunt Monica's little boy!"
,"Oh, let me see! Oh, God, is he just the sweetest thing? You must just want to kiss him all over!"
,That would be nice.
"Nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. Pffft. Pffffffft.",Pardon?
"Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back.",
"I will, really. I'll pay you back this time.","Oh, yeah, right, OK... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe me... 17 jillion dollars."
Well... I'm helping out down at the N.Y.U. Med School with some... research.,... And where's this money coming from?
"Oh, just, y'know.... science.",What kind of research?
... It's a fertility study.,"Science. Yeah, I think I've heard of that."
"Oh, Joey, please tell me you're only donating your time.",
Hey.,"Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey, but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars."
"OK, we got the cole slaw, we got the buns...","Wow, ooh, you're gonna be making money hand over fist!"
,"We've got the ground-up flesh of formerly cute cows and turkeys, ew..."
We make fire. Cook meat.,Men are here.
Ewww!,"Then put out fire by peeing, no get invited back."
"Oh, OK.","Oh Joey, Melanie called, said she's gonna be late."
"I don't know, she's, uh.... she's pretty great.",So how are things going with you two? Is she becoming your special someone?
"What, you think I'm gonna tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup?",Yeah? What does she think of your little science project?
"Well, the tough thing is, she really wants to have sex with me.",Man's got a point.
"Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according to the rules, if I want to get the money I'm not allowed to conduct any... ersonal experiments, if you know what I mean.",Crazy bitch.
,Joey... we always know what you mean.
Hey.,Hey.
How long did you think this barbecue was gonna last?,Hey.
"Jeez, you say one thing, and...",I'm going to China.
"Yeah, i-it's for the museum. Someone found a bone, we want the bone, but they don't want us to have the bone, so I'm going over there to try to persuade them to give us the boit'sit's a whole big bone thing. Anyway, I'm gonna be gone for like, uh... like a week, so, uh, if you wanna reach me, y-you can't. So here's my itinerary . Um... here's a picture of me...",You're going to China?
": Could you take it to Carol's every now and then, and show it to Ben, just so he doesn't forget me?","Oh, let me see!"
,Yeah.
"Hey, is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her a happy birthday before I left.","Hi, Ben. I'm your father. I am... the head. Aaaaaahhhh.... Alright, this barbecue is gonna be very fun."
"Oh. Hey, who's Carl?","Oh no, she's out having drinks with Carl."
No.,"You know, that guy she met at the coffeehouse."
"At the coffeehouse, right.","Oh, well, see, there's this guy she met at the..."
"OK, I'm gonna go say goodbye to the guys.",So you do know who he is! Sorry.
,"Oh, hey, y'know what? Tell them that bone story."
Hey!,Hi.
....I have to go to China.,Hey!
"No no, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront. Do you guys know who Carl is?",The country?
"Well, Rachel's having drinks with him tonight.","Uh, let's see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no."
Forget about her.,Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!?
"Course there, they just call it food.","He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food."
"Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you.","Yeah... I guess. I don'tI don't know. Alright, just... just give her this for me, OK?"
"We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but... I love you, man.",I know.
,I'm still on my first. I just think you're nice.
"Like the three musketeers, only with fruit.","Anyway, that's when me and my friends started this whole fruit basket business. We call ourselves 'The Three Basketeers.'"
"OK, how does everybody like their burgers?",Ooooh.
,"Oh, no, no, no. Presents first. Food later."
"Well, not so good. She definitely thinks tonight is the night we're gonna... complete the transaction, if you know what I...","Hey, hold on there, tiger. How's it going? How you holding up?"
"Then you do. Heh, heh.",
What do you mean?,"So, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her?"
,"Y'know, just be there for her."
Think about it.,Not following you.
"OK, I'm guessing this is from...",
"Well, thank you, Melanie.",
"OK... ah, it's light... ...it rattles... it's... Travel Scrabble! Oooohhh, thank you!","OK, this one right here is from me."
This one's from Joey... feels like a book. Thinks it's a book... feels like a book. And... ...it's a book!,
: That book got me through some tough times.,"Oh, it's Dr. Seuss!"
"Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.",There is a little child inside this man!
Who's this from?,
Oh... ... Oh my God. He remembered.,"Oh, that's Ross's."
"It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!",Remembered what?
"Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.","Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane?"
"Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?",I can't believe he did this.
What did you just say?,
"No, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?",ahem... um... Crystal duck.
Oh.... my God.,F-hah.... flennin....
"That's good, just keep rubbing your head. That'll turn back time.","Oh, no-no-no-no-no...."
"I know. This is really, really huge.","I mean, this is unbelievable."
Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again.,No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.
"I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?","OK, is there a mute button on this woman?"
"Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something.","No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... : W-well, what else did he say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me?"
H-He's in China!,"Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him."
"No, no, wait. His flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes.",The country.
From here to the airport?,What about the time difference?
"Rachel, what're you gonna say to him?",Yes! You're never gonna make it!
Well then maybe you shouldn't go.,I-I-I don't know.
"Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now.","He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait."
"Here, look, alright, does this help?",I don't know. Maybe I'll know when I see him.
"Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him. I mean, this is just too big. Y'know, I just, I've just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta... OK, I'll see you later.",
,"Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first!"
Ni-chou chi-ma!,Alright!
"Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me....",
Hi!,
May I see your boarding pass?,Hi.
"Oh, oooh. I'm sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass.","Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend."
No no no! Federal regulations!,"No, I know, but Ihe just went on. He's right there, he's got the blue jacket on, I... can I j-just..."
Alright. What's the message?,"OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me? Please? This is very important."
,Uh... I don't know.
What?,"Sir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh... I have a message for you."
": Toby... Oh, for God's sake, I don't know what she's talking about! There's no Rachel! Don't give me that deep freeze.","It's from Rachel. She said that she loved the present, and she will see you when you get back."
"Heh, heh. It was nothin'.","Mmmmmm... Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey... I think I blacked out there for a minute!"
"Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give you another turn.","Well, now we've gotta find something fun for you!"
Sure! Why not?,M-Me again?
,"Boy, somebody's gonna get a big fruit basket tomorrow."
How do you mean?,"Oooh, I gotta tell you... you are nothing like I thought you would be."
"Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?","I don't know, I-I guess I just had you pegged as one of those guys who're always 'me, me, me.' But you... you're a giver. You're like the most generous man I ever met. I mean... you're practically a woman."
Sure.,"I don't know. I don't know... I thought about it all the way there, and I thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's Ross. Y'know what I mean? I mean, it's Ross."
"Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date!","I don't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I'm thinking... oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great."
Another good point.,"Yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date."
Huh?,"No, I mean, I mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you're already in a very relationshippy place. Y'know, it's... you're committed."
Why isn't it working out?,"Well, I mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out?"
Is he not cute enough for you?,I don't know... sometimes it doesn't.
Does he not make enough money?,No!
Maybe there's someone else.,"No, I'm just...."
Is there? Is there someone else?,Wha...
Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!?,No! There is.. there is noone else!
Shhhh!,"Hey, big..."
She's still asleep.,...spender.
"Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?",So how'd it go?
"Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!",The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.
"It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.","Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route."
I know! Neither did I!,I didn't know you had another level.
Yeah.,"Hey, great skirt! Birthday present?"
From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me.,"Oh, from who?"
"Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and I've decided thisthis whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea.","Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27-B?"
"Because, I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him. I would be going out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don't wanna...","Oh, why?"
"Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so...","No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!"
,"I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be good. I promise."
"It's me, Carl.",Who is it?
Behind my brother's back? ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.,C'mon up.
"Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?",Seven hundred bucks!
"Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?","Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something."
"I'm just sayin', if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in that stupid electric car, I'm gonna shoot myself! I mean, don't get me wrong... I'm not against environmental issues per se.... it's just that guy!","What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this?"
I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.,
"Fine, just stop thinking about me.","Would you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here."
"Can't do it, can you?",
"I don't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway?",So I'm thinking about you. So what?
"I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car!",Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy....
"Ross, it's too hard.","Rachel, come on. Give us a chance."
"Ross, you're like my best friend.","No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares about them. This is about us. Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade."
"If we broke up, and I lost you...",I know.
"Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?","Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we're gonna break up?"
"I don't know... I mean, I've never looked at you that way before.","No. But... it only has to happen once. Look, you and I both know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me?"
,"Well, start looking."
Exactly! And you just know I'm gonna be the guy caught behind this hammerhead in traffic!,Wow.
Heh... y'know?,Right! You're right!
What?,You know what?
,"I forgot... I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. I am so sorry! I'm so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do.... I meanI'm sorry. I-I-I gotta go. I'm sorry."
"Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi.",But...
"For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!",
"Oh, hey, hey, I got that.",
"Oh, thanks, sweetie.",
Really?,No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.
You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me?,Yeah.
Can't wait.,"No, no, they will. I just... uh..."
,"Come on, they're gonna love you."
"Ok, so this is pretty much what's happened so far. Ross was in love with Rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of got in the way, like cats, and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like ""forget about her"" but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was in love with Rachel. She was like, ""Oh my god."" So she went to the airport to meet him when he came back, but what she didn't know was, that Ross was getting off the plane with another woman. Uh-Oh! So, that's pretty much everything you need to know. But, enough about us. So, how've you been?",
Oh my god. Oh my god. Excuse me. Move! Move! Emergency! Excuse me!,
"Oh, there you are! Hi! Oh, so, so, how was China, you?",Rach!
What?,"It was, it was great. Oh, what happened?"
"I am? Oh, look at that, yes I am. Enough about me, enough about me, Mr. Back from the Orient. Come on. I wanna hear everything! Everything.",You're bleeding.
"These are, these aren't for you. These are for you. Welcome to our country.","Well, where do I start? This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel."
"Ok, well, not a problem. We'll just use them to stop the bleeding. Ok. Baggage claim? Ok.",Thank you. I'm from New York.
No way!,
"Oh my god. This is huge. This is bigger than huge. This is like, all right, what's bigger than huge?","I'm telling you, she went to the airport, and she's gonna go for it with Ross!"
Yes.,"Um, this?"
"Yes, yes, we did, thanks to Vidal Buffay.","Guys, you got your hair cut."
"Airport, airport. Ross, not alone, Julie, arm around her. Cramp, cramp.","'Cause, you know, if you don't look good, we don't look good. I love that voice."
"You, you, you said he liked me. You, you slowpokes!","Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs."
What up?!,"That's all right, Rach, we got the bags. Hi, hello. Julie, this is my sister Monica. This is Chandler. Phoebe. Joey, what up?"
Julie.,"Everyone, this is Julie."
"Hi, but I'm not here, you haven't met me. I'll make a much better first impression tomorrow when I don't have 20 hours of cab and plane on me.",Ohh. Hi!
Oh my god.,And bus.
And the spitting?,The screaming guy?
"We're on this bus, that's easily 200 years old...",You gotta hear this story.
...and this guy...,200 at least.
"This is amazing. I mean, how, how did this happen?","And the chicken pooped in her lap. Oh, I'm so sorry. I just gave away the ending, didn't I? Oh! It's just, I just heard this story in the cab, and it is all I can think about."
"But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.","Well, Ross and I were in grad school together."
It's an expression.,"Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?"
And then we've gotta get some sleep.,"Well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we're gonna go see the baby."
"Well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though, 'cause I like to be surprised.","Yeah, it's really 6:00 tomorrow night our time."
,Bye.
"Yeah, sure.","Hey, Rach, can I get some coffee?"
"Hey, Rach, can I get...",Thank you.
Not yet.,Did you talk to him?
"So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know.","Then, no."
God?,"I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was?"
"Well, maybe it was God, doing me.","It was you, pal."
"Well, you owe me one, big guy.","Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I have to say, I never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you."
I didn't order lemonade.,Here's your lemonade.
But...,"Oh. Well then, you better go take that back because they're gonna charge you for that."
"He said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself! Without any outside help whatsoever.","Go-go-go-go, come on! So uh, what did you find out?"
You have to really wanna see it.,How is that the silver lining?
"Ironically, these are the guys who were picked last in gym.",
"Oh, ok. How, it's been so long since you've had sex, you're wondering if they've changed it?","Pheebes, you know what I'm thinking?"
"All right, so what were you thinking?","No, although now that's what I'm thinking."
Ohh! No.,"Well, I was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, I thought, maybe you'd like to do mine?"
"Because, I'm just, I'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak.",Why not?
"I know I'm not, but you are, and I was trying to spare your feelings.",No you're not.
Hello? Hi.,"Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. Ross, it's Julie, for you."
Needs some clothes altered?,Hi. Anybody know a good tailor?
"Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. He did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15. All right, when was 1990?","No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk."
"Ok, ok, sweetheart, I'll see you later. Ok, bye. What? Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three. Well you didn't hang up either.",Okay. You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!
"Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y...",She didn't hang up either!
Rachel! I'll just call her back.,"Sorry, I thought you were talking to me."
"Hi? Sorry, we got disconnected...",Okay!
"Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.","Ok, ok, ok. How did this happen to me? How did this happen to me? A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine. Ross was just Ross, just this guy. Now he's Rrrooossss, oh, this really great guy that I can't have."
"Ok, I don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her.","I know you did. I'm just gonna deal with it, I'm just gonna deal with it. I gotta get out of here."
"You know, I think I was sixteen.",
"I'm still on ""no.""","Please, just a little bit off the back."
"No-no-no-no-no, I'm not fallin' for that again.","Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?"
"Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.",What's goin' on?
Bon giorno tutti!,What stupid thing did you do?
,Ewww!
"Rachel, how did this happen?","Ok, Paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your way, ok, bye-bye."
Where?,"I don't know, I just kinda ran into him last night."
"Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?",At his apartment. Is this juice?
"Honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad.","Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser."
"My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't..., but this is about your horrible mistake.",People do stupid things when they're upset.
"Hi. Sorry we're late but we werewell, there was touching.",Hi!
"Hey, Paulo. What are you doing here?","Hey, hey Ross."
"So, uh, he's back.",I do Raquel.
"No, not a problem.","Yeah, he's back. Is that a problem?"
"Ok, you're gonna have to not touch my ass.",Good! I'm glad it's not a problem.
"Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello. He'll know what it means.","Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've got pants that need to be altered."
"You know it's funny, the last time Paulo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter.",Are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?
I promise.,"All right. Ok, but, but! You have to promise that you will not be all like control-y and bossy and Monica about it."
,"All right. Now some of you are gonna get cut, and some of you aren't. But I promise none of you are gonna feel a thing."
What? I didn't say anything.,"All right, that's it, I quit."
"I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed.","Yeah, but this isn't the face of a person who trusts a person. Ok, this is the face of a person who, you know, doesn't trust a person."
How who wears it?,Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.
Demi Moore is not a he.,Demi Moore.
That's Dudley Moore. I said I wanted it like Demi Moore.,"Well, he was a he in Arthur, and in Ten."
Oh my God!,Oh. Oh!
Oh my God!,Oh my God!
"She's the actress that was in Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost!","Oh my God! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Which one's Demi Moore?"
I know!,"Oh, she's got gorgeous hair."
How long do you want the cuffs?,
"I just got that. Ok, now we'll do your inseam.",At least as long as I have the pants.
How is she?,
How's the hair?,"It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign."
Can we see her?,"I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good. I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling."
Yeah.,"Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, why don't you come on in."
I'm okay.,How're you doing?
What?,"Ooh, that bad, huh?"
"When I saw him get off that plane with her, I really thought I hit rock bottom. But today, it's like there's rock bottom, 50 feet of crap, then me.","Look, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. It's one of my gifts."
Come on. How can I just tell him? What about Julie?,You gotta tell Ross how you feel.
"I don't know, I don't know.",What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks. Ross has been in love with you for like 10 years.
"Yo, paisan! Can I talk to you for a sec? Your tailor is a very bad man!","Look, Rach, Rach! I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you."
"Hey, what's goin' on?",Frankie? What're you talking about?
What?,Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
"Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...",No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
Cupping.,What?
"Yes, yes it is. In prison! Whatsa matter with you?","That's how they do pants! First they go up one side, they move it over, then they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear. What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?"
,What? That's not? Oh my God.
"I like it. I do, I think it's a Ten.",Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better.
"Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught between the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true.",Thank you. My hair is very amused.
"Well, I gotta go. Bye. Bye, Rach.",Thank you.
"Yeah, that's kinda what I meant by ""bye!""","Wait, are you leaving?"
Okay.,"Well, can I talk to you for a sec?"
That's ok.,"Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test..."
"Well, first of all, Paulo and I are not back together. It was just a stupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I wouldn't. Um, second of all , what?",What's goin' on?
No. No-no-no-no.,"Ok. Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of those things where you break up with a guy, and then I tell you what I think, and then the next day you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot?"
Really?,"Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I mean I actuallyI-I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a guy like that."
"No, I think that was the whole all.","You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know? Someone who wakes up every morning thinking ""Oh my god, I'm with Rachel"". You know, someone who makes you feel good, the way I am with Julie. Was there a second of all?"
"I swear to god, Dad. That's not how they measure pants.",Okay. Okay. Okay.
"I was thinking of doing it a little shorter, you know, like Andie McDowell's new haircut?",
Really?,"Oh yeah! Oh, I can do that."
Great!,You wanna do it right now?
No. No no no no no. That's Rodney McDowell. Andie McDowell is the guy from Planet of the Apes.,"Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time. Andie McDowell's the girl from Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?"
You're welcome.,"Oh, yeah. Ok, thank you."
"Ok, these were unbelievably expensive, and I know he's gonna grow out of them in like, 20 minutes, but I couldn't resist.",
"Oh, is he hungry already?","Oh, look at these! Hey, Ben. Just do it. Oh my God, oh, ok, was that too much pressure for him?"
"You know, it's... something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back.",I guess so.
What are you guys doing?,"I gotta get one, too."
"Look, would you guys grow up? That is the most natural beautiful thing in the world.",We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle?
"This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gonna happen a lot, so you'd better get used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it, now come on.","Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it."
Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding?,Carol?
"Uh, does it hurt?",Sure.
Chandler?,"It did at first, but not anymore."
As much as he needs.,"So, uh, how often can you do it?"
,"Ok, I got one, I got one. Uh, if he blows into one, does the other one get bigger?"
"Yeah, I forget which ones.","Rachel, do you have any muffins left?"
No thanks.,"Oh, you're busy, that's ok, I'll get it. Anybody else want one?"
Thank you. What a bitch.,"Oh, you're losin' your apron here, let me get it. There you go."
"I can't, I have to take my grandmother to the vet.","Oh, listen you guys. I have this friend at Bloomingdale's who's quitting tomorrow and he wants to abuse his discount. So, anyone want to come with me and take advantage of it?"
Great.,"Ok, um, I'll go with you."
"Hey, sweetums.","Hi, honey."
Hi!,Hello to the rest.
"It's gonna be a problem, isn't it?",Monica what're you doin'? You can't go shopping with her? What about Rachel?
But I'm...,"Come on, you're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie? That's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship."
"So, uh, Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow?","Monica, she will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street."
"It's a big deal to me. This is great, Monica. I really appreciate this.","Yeah, uh, it's actually not that big a deal."
"Woof, woof.",You're welcome.
Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Hey Annabelle.,
Who?,"Hey, Joey. So did you hear about the new guy?"
Hombre?,Nobody knows his name. Me and the girls just call him the Hombre man.
I guess he doesn't know.,What's he doin' in my section?
Mornin'.,"Well, he's gonna. I'll see you a little later, ok? Hey, how ya doin'?"
"Your territory, huh?","Listen, I know you're new, but it's kinda understood that everything from Young Men's to the escalator is my territory."
No thanks.,Yeah. Bijan for men?
Yeah. All right.,Hombre?
,You were saying?
What?,"Phoebe, listen. You were with me, and we were shopping all day."
"Oh, all right. What did I have?","We were shopping, and we had lunch."
"Oh, no wonder I don't feel full.",You had a salad.
"I went shopping with Monica all day, and I had a salad.","Hey, guys, what's up."
"Um, we went shopping for um, for, fur.","Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy?"
"Yes, and then I realized I'm against that, and uh, so then we bought some, uh, boobs.",You went shopping for fur?
Bras! We bought bras! We bought bras.,You bought boobs?
"Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for... Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee.",
"Ready, Annabelle?","Oh, actually I sorta have plans."
"Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne. Bijan for men? Bijan for men?!",You bet. Maybe some other time?
"Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep.",
"Honey, relax. Ross is great with him. Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person.","Carol, we've been through this before, ok? We have a good time. We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son."
"Oh, I got that for him.","Oh, this is so cute."
"Hello? Oh, Hi, Ju Hi, Jew! Uh huh? Uh huh? Ok. Um, sure, that'd be great. See ya then. Bye.",My mommies love me. That's clever.
"Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.","Did you just say Hi, Jew?"
"Ben, dinner!",
"Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok.","Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you didn't microwave that, did you, because it's breast milk, and you're not supposed to do that."
"I licked my arm, what?",What did you just do?
So?,It's breast milk.
What is the big deal?,"Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person."
"Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?",What did you just do?
No!,You won't even taste it?
Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.,Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?
"Hey, where is everybody?",
"Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. Thanks for your jacket.",They took Ben to the park. Where've you been?
Okay.,"Oh, no problem. You can borrow it, by the way. Here are your keys, hon."
You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my credit card.,"Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53 dollars?"
That is an excellent excellent question. That is excellent.,And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket?
Judy.,"Monica, what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with?"
Julie.,Who?
Jody!,What?!
"Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend. And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were...shopping.",You were with Julie?
"Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me.",Oh. Oh my God.
"Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry, all right. I never meant for you to find out!","Yeah, right. Sure!"
That is not true!,"Oh, please, you wanted to get caught."
Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?,"Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?"
,"Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's? Oh! Ok, ok, ok, I just really, uh, I just really need to not be with you right now."
Hey!,"Hi, who's this? Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica. Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. Joanne, it's not as simple as all that, ok? No, I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve."
"Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out.",How did we do?
Why'd you freak out?,I did not freak out.
My breast milk is gross?,Because it's breast milk. It's gross.
"No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just, I just don't think breast milk is for adults.",This should be fun.
"Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal. Just taste it.",Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.
Come on. It doesn't taste bad.,That would be no.
Cantaloupe juice.,"Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh..."
You've tasted it? You've tasted it.,Exactly.
"Oh, you've tasted it.",Uh huh.
Gimme the bottle. Gimme the towel.,"You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true."
Howdy.,
"Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.","Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre."
What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.,"Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it. You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day."
"All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run?","I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese."
You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.,Yeah I guess you're right.
All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.,I'm gonna do it.
I don't know what else to say.,
"I feel terrible, I really do.","Well that works out good, because I'm not listening."
"Rachel, say that I'm friends with her, we spend some time together. Is that so terrible?","Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?"
It's that terrible?,Yes.
"Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean, you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you.","Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually , but now she's actually stealing you."
"You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but um I love you guys too. Oh, I really needed that.",I love you too.
"I'd do anything for you, you know that.","Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. Would you just give that a chance, for me?"
"Wait, wait, wait, wait!",I'd do anything for you.
"Mornin'. I said, mornin'.",
"All right, everybody, I'm openin' the doors. You boys ready?",I heard ya.
"Yeah, I'm ready.",Ready.
"Oh my god, Todd! What the hell did you do?","You idiot, you stupid cowboy, you blinded me, I'm suing!"
"My god, what happened?","I'm sorry. I am such a doofus. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry."
Sure.,"These new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they all...stop lastin'. Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?"
So.,
"I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.","So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you know, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?"
"Yes. Oh my god, are you kidding? Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't.",Really? Me?
Oy.,"Well, you're not totally paranoid."
"Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?","Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right."
"I'd love it too. Shoot, I gotta go. So, I'll talk to you later.","Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it."
Bye.,"All right, Julie."
,Bye. What a manipulative bitch.
Hey.,That's not bad.
I broke up with her.,So how was Joan?
"Come on, they were not that huge.","They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them."
How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?,"I'm tellin' you, she leaned back, I could see her brain."
You or me?,"Hold it hold it. I gotta side with Chandler on this one. When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple. It made me nuts."
"You guys are messin' with me, right?","I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples."
"That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, ""whoa.""",Yeah.
Maureen Rosilla.,You name one woman that you broke up with for a real reason.
"Hello, Mr. Heckles.",Not hating Yanni is not a real reason.
We're not doing anything.,You're doing it again.
You don't have birds.,You're stomping. It's disturbing my birds.
"Ok, Mr. Heckles, we'll try to keep it down.",I could have birds.
"All right, bye-bye.",Thank you. I'm going to rejoin my dinner party.
We'll give you Janice.,"Ok, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about being picky."
"""Oh, my, god.""","I miss Janice though. ""Hello, Chandler Bing."""
"Stop with the broom, we're not making noise.","""Oh, Chandler, now, now, that's it. There, faster!"""
Mr. Heckles.,We won. We won!
He musta been sweepin'. They found a broom in his hand.,How did this happen?
I know. I was sweepin' yesterday. It coulda been me.,That's terrible.
You never know.,"Sure, sweepin'. You never know."
"Ok, Phoebe.","Ok, it's very faint, but I can still sense him in the building. Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!"
Such as?,"I'm sorry, but sometimes they need help. That's fine. Go ahead and scoff. You know, there're a lot of things that I don't believe in, but that doesn't mean they're not true."
"Whoa, whoa, whoa. What, you don't, uh, you don't believe in evolution?","Like crop circles, or the Bermuda triangle, or evolution?"
You don't believe in evolution?,Nah. Not really.
"Too easy? Too...The process of every living thing on this planet evolving over millions of years from single-celled organisms, too easy?","I don't know, it's just, you know...monkeys, Darwin, you know, it's a, it's a nice story, I just think it's a little too easy."
"Uh, excuse me. Evolution is not for you to buy, Phoebe. Evolution is scientific fact, like, like, like the air we breathe, like gravity.","Yeah, I just don't buy it."
"You uh, you don't believe in gravity?","Ok, don't get me started on gravity."
"Uh-Oh. It's Isaac Newton, and he's pissed.","Well, it's not so much that you know, like I don't believe in it, you know, it's just...I don't know, lately I get the feeling that I'm not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed."
What can we do for you?,"There she is. And over there, that's the other one. This is Mr. Buddy Boyle, Mr. Heckles' attorney. He'd like to talk to you."
"Well, what about his family?","All right, kids. Here's the deal. According to my client's will, he wants to leave all his earthly possessions to ""the noisy girls in the apartment above mine""."
"Ok, so let's talk money.",He didn't have any.
"I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us. I mean, isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life, without even knowing it?...Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!","All right, there was none. Let's talk signing. You be noisy girl number one, you be noisy girl number two."
"Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap",Have you ever seen so much crap?
How can you not believe in evolution?,Check this out. Can I have this?
"Pheebs, I have studied evolution my entire adult life. Ok, I can tell you, we have collected fossils from all over the world that actually show the evolution of different species, ok? You can literally see them evolving through time.",Just don't. Look at this funky shirt!
"You bet. In the U.S., China, Africa, all over.",Really? You can actually see it?
"Well, there you go.","See, I didn't know that."
"Hey, look at this. ""My Big Book of Grievances.""","Huh. So now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why?"
"April 18th, excessive noise. Italian guy's gay roommate comes home with the dry-cleaning. Well that's excellent.","Hey, there's me! April 17th. Excessive noise. Italian guy comes homes with a date. Hey Chandler, look, you're in here too."
"Rache, I think we have enough regular lamps.","Monica, Monica, look at this lamp. Is this tacky or what? We have to have this."
It doesn't go with any of my stuff.,"What? Come on, it's not like I'm asking for this girly clock or anything, which, by the way, I also think is very cool."
You don't have any stuff.,"Well, what about my stuff?"
No.,"You still think of it as your apartment, don't you?"
Mmmmm.,"Yes you do. You think of it as your apartment, and I'm just somebody who rents a room."
"Ok, Pheebs. See how I'm making these little toys move? Opposable thumbs. Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?","Ok, while you ""mmm"" on it for awhile, I'm gonna go find a place for my new lamp."
Please tell me you're joking.,Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.
"No, no, Pheebs, we can't, ok, because--","Look, can't we just say that you believe in something, and I don't."
Is there blood coming out of my ears?,"What is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you? No, what's that all about? I think, I think maybe it's time you put Ross under the microscope."
"Wow, he looks so normal.","Check it out, check it out. Heckles' high school yearbook."
"""Heckles, you crack me up in science class. You're the funniest kid in school.",He's even kind of cute.
That's what it says.,Funniest? Heckles?
I'd call that excessive.,"Wow, Heckles was voted class clown, and so was I. He was right. Would you listen to that?"
What?,Whoa!
"So, you were both dorks. Big deal.","Heckles played clarinet in band, and I played clarinet. And he was in the scale modeler's club, and I was, well, there was no club, but I sure thought they were cool."
Have you been here all night?,"I just think it's weird, you know? Heckles and me, Heckles, and me, me and Heckles...Would you knock it off?"
"Chandler, Heckles was a nut case.","Look at this. Pictures of all the women that Heckles went out with. Look what he wrote on them. Vivian, too tall. Madge, big gums. Too loud, too smart, makes noise when she eats. This is, this is me. This is what I do. I'm gonna end up alone, just like he did."
"All right, you know what we gotta do? We gotta get you outta here. Come on, I'll buy you breakfast, let's go.","Our trains are on the same track, ok? Yeah, sure, I'm coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same. Bitter Town. Aloneville. Hermit Junction."
"Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody.","What if I never find someone? Or worse, what if I've found her, but I dumped her because she pronounced it ""supposably""?"
"I don't know, I'm just tryin' to help you out.",How do you know that? How?
"Well, I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna be doin'. I mean, what if we're at her folks' place?","You'll see, you guys are all gonna go off and get married, and I'm gonna end up alone. Will you promise me something? When you're married, will you invite me over for holidays?"
"You can come over and watch the Super Bowl. Every year, all right?","Yeah, I understand."
Supposably. Supposably. Did they go to the zoo? Supposably.,You know what? I'm not gonna end up like this. I'll see you man.
"Oh, my, god.","Hi, it's me."
"Yes, Janice. Why is that so difficult for you to comprehend?",Janice? You called Janice?
"Yes. She was smart, she was pretty, and she honestly cared about me. Janice is my last chance to have somebody.","You remember Janice, right?"
"Oh, my, god!",Helloo!!
"Hey, it's everybody.","Geez, look how fat she got."
"Yes, I am.","Janice, you're--"
"Is it yours? Ha! You wish, Chandler Bing. You are looking at a married lady now.",Is it--?
"Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.",Congratulations.
And what? Missed the expression on your face? Janice likes to have her fun.,You couldn't have told me about this on the phone?
What?,"Hey, Rache. You know what we haven't played in a while?"
"Monica, let it go.",Hide the Lamp.
"Well, then, you'll just have to eat the other lamps.",Did you know I was allergic to shellfish?
"Ok, Phoebe, this is it. In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts. A briefcase of facts, if you will. Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old.",Uh-oh. It's Scary Scientist Man.
"It's the only possibility, Phoebe.","Ok, look, before you even start, I'm not denying evolution, ok, I'm just saying that it's one of the possibilities."
"There might be, a teeny, tiny, possibility.","Ok, Ross, could you just open your mind like this much, ok? Wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat? And, up until like what, 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out. Now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can't admit that there's a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this?"
What?,I can't believe you caved.
I am. Let me just get my coat.,"You just abandoned your whole belief system. I mean, before, I didn't agree with you, but at least I respected you. How, how, how are you going to go into work tomorrow? How, how are you going to face the other science guys? How, how are you going to face yourself? Oh! That was fun. So who's hungry?"
"Oh, please, Monica. You've always hated my lamp, and then, all of a sudden, it's just magically broken?","Ok, all right. It was an accident, I swear, all right. I was putting on my jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke."
"Ok, I didn't see it, because I was putting on my jacket, but I uh want to believe you.","Phoebe, tell her!"
Neat. I'm gonna die alone.,Hey Chandler. Monica just broke my seashell lamp.
"Chandler, you're not gonna die alone.","Ok, you win."
Uh huh. Why is that?,"Janice was my safety net, ok? And now I have to get a snake."
You have got to get over this. You're not gonna end up alone.,"If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man, I'm gonna need a thing, you know, a hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face. So I figure I'll be Crazy Man with a Snake, yknow. Crazy Snake Man. And I'll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will walk past my place, they will run. ""Run away from Crazy Snake Man,"" they'll shout!"
"Chandler, you have just described virtually every man that we have ever gone out with.","Of course I am. I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there."
She's right. She's right. You are no different than the rest of them.,You are not a freak. You're a guy.
In a bad way?,"Wait a minute, wait a minute. Yes he is. You are totally different."
Yeah. You're not gonna end up alone.,"No, honey, in a wonderful way. You know what you want now. Most guys don't even have a clue. You are ready to take risks, you are ready to be vulnerable, and intimate with someone."
You made it!,"Chandler, you called Janice! That's how much you wanted to be with someone!"
You are ready to make a commitment!,You're there!
What you got there? Something else that's not yours that you can break?,Whoa! Don't know about that.
Thank you.,"No. Um, I know you like this, and I want you to have it. I think it'll look good in our apartment."
"Hey. Well, you will all be pleased to know that I have a date tomorrow night. This woman, Alison, from work. She's great. She's pretty, she's smart. And uh, I've been holding off on asking her out in the past, because she has an unusually large head. But, I'm not gonna let that stuff hang me up anymore. Look at me. I'm growing.",That's fine.
I'll take that.,"Hey, uh, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you?"
"Yeah, yeah. Some people said some nice things about him. I think somebody should have it.",You want his yearbook?
It's really not that big!,"Oh, gosh, this is so weird. I mean, his whole life was in this apartment, and now it's gone. You know, I think it would be nice if we just took a few moments, for Mr. Heckles. I mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but, he was a person. You're all going to hell."
"Oh, yeah.","Takin' that with you, huh?"
"Yeah, jus' second. Good-bye Mr. Heckles. We'll try to keep it down.",You comin'?
Sure.,"Oh, my major was totally useless. I mean, how often do you look in the classifieds and see ""Philosopher wanted""?"
"Mom, would you relax. That was 10 blocks from here and, the, the woman was walking alone at night, I would never do that. Mom, c'mon, stop worrying. This is a safe street, this is a safe building, there's nothing OH MY GOOOD, oh my God, oh I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go. OK, that's fine, you just read the paper, I'm gonna get a pot, it's not for you. OK, that's fine, read the Family Circus, enjoy the gentle comedy. Aaahh, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, aaaaahh. It's open you guys.",
"Hi, hi can I help you?",Hi.
"Uh, no she doesn't but I can, I can get a message to her.","Yeah, I'm looking for Phoebe, does she still live here?"
What?,"Great. Uhh, just tell her her husband stopped by."
,"Hey, how, how did you do that?"
"Well, I mean, I'm not married married, ya know, he's just a friend and he's gay and he's just from Canada and he just needed a green card.","This is unbelievable Phoebs, how can you be married?"
"I'm sorry Monica but I knew if I told you, you'd get really, like, judgemental and you would not approve.","I can't believe you married Duncan. I mean how could you not tell me? We lived together, we told each other everything."
"You see, and you thought she'd be judgemental.","Of course I wouldn't approve, I mean, you were totally in love with this guy who, hello, was gay. I mean, what the hell were you thinking?"
"Please, when he left town you stayed in your pajamas for a month and I saw you eat a cheeseburger.","OK, I wasn't in love with him and I was just helping out a friend."
"Well, didn't you?",Huuh.
I can't believe you didn't tell me.,I might have.
What have I not told you?,"Oh, c'mon, like you tell me everything."
What!,"Oh, I don't know. Umm, how about the fact that the underwear out there on the telephone pole is yours from when you were having sex with Fun Bobby out on the terrace."
I didn't know it was a big secret.,"Wait a minute, who told you? You are dead meat."
You have a third nipple?,"Oh it's not big, not at all, you know, kinda the same lines as, say, oh I don't know, having a third nipple."
"Whip it out, whip it out.",You bitch.
"Oh as, as opposed to your other multi-functional nipples?","C'mon, there's nothin' to see, it's just a tiny bump, it's totally useless."
"Joey, what did you think a nubbin was?",I can't believe you. You told me it was a nubbin.
"Yeah, show it. Show it. The nubbin, the nubbin, the nubbin.","I don't know, you see somethin', you hear a word, I thought that's what it was. Let me see it again."
Huuh.,Joey was in a porno movie.
You were in a porno?,"If I'm goin' down, I'm takin' everybody with me."
That is wild.,"Ahh, alright, alright, alright, I was young and I just wanted a job, OK. But at the last minute I couldn't go through with it so they let me be the guy who comes in to fix the copier but can't 'cause there's people havin' sex on it."
"Yeah, is there a hair on it?",So what's it shaped like?
,What happens if you flick it?
"Why yes Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of Narnia.","So, uh, does it do anything, you know, special?"
"Huh? Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area?","You know, in some cultures having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility. You get the best huts and women dance naked around you."
"Ooh, Julie's so smart, Julie's so special.","You know, you are so amazing, is there anything you, you don't know?"
"Ohh, I'm gonna have to get over it. God, see I didn't know that's I had to do, I just have to get over it.","Look honey, I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did. But he's with her now and you're just gonna have to get over it."
Foxy lady.,Woah.
"Um, I'm gonna go meet Duncan, he's skating tonight at the Garden, he's in the Capades.",Where you goin'?
"No, no the gravel capades. Yeah, the turns aren't as fast but when Snoopy falls. . . funny.",The Ice Capades?
"OK, no. For your information I'm going to see him so I can put all those feeling behind me. OK, and the reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice to look nice for your gay husband.","I can't believe you're dressing up for him. I mean, you're just, you're setting yourself up all over again."
"Oh I see, I see, because of the third nipple thing. Ha ha ha ha. . .","Oh, darnit, we're all out of milk. Hey Chandler, would you fill me up here?"
"OK sweetie, I'll see you later.",
Bye-bye Julie.,See you later Rach.
Hey.,Hey.
Hey?,"Hey, c'mon, cut it out."
Can I ask you somethin'?,What?
Naa.,Sure.
"OK, what's the longest you've been in the relationship before ha, have, having the sex?","What? C'mon, talk to me."
"Technically, huh, no.","Why? Who's not having. . . Are you and Julie not, are, are you and, are you and Julie not having sex?"
"No, no, she's great and it's not like we haven't done anything. I mean, uh, uh, we, we do plenty of other stuff, lot's of other stuff, like uhh. . .","Wow. Is it, is it 'cause she's so cold in bed. Or, or is it 'cause she's like, kinda bossy, makes it feel like school?"
"It's just, it's, it's me. You, you know I've only been with one woman my whole life and she turned out to be a lesbian. So now I've got myself all psyched out, you know, and it's become, like this, this thing and I. . . Well, you just must think I'm weird.","No, no no no, don't need to know the details."
What?,"No, no, no, no I don't think it's weird, I think, I think umm, in fact, in fact you know what I think?"
Sexy?,I think it's sexy.
No kidding?,Let me tell you something. As a woman there is nothing sexier than a man who does not want to have sex.
What?,Oh yeah. In fact you know what I'd do?
You'd wait?,I'd wait.
Really?,"Yes, absolutely. I would wait and wait. . . then I'd wait some more."
Women really want this?,"Oh yeah, I don't care how much she tells you she wants it, I don't care if begs, she pleads, she tells you she, she's gonna have sex with, with another man. That just means it's working."
,More than jewelry.
Phoebe!,Hi.
Hey.,Ta-da.
"Ahh, look at you, you look great.",Hi.
Thanks.,"Do I? Thank you, so do you."
You always said I'd make it.,"Sparkly. So, wow, this is pretty wonerful, huh. Mr. major capades guy. I, I remember when you were just, like, King Friday in Mr. Roger's Ice is Nice."
I missed you. I'm gonna get changed.,"Yeah, well, ya know, I'm kind of spooky that way. Wooo."
"Um, now. Phoebs.",OK.
What?,"Oh, right, OK. Ole."
,"Um, the matador. Ole, ha ha ha."
"Uh, Julie.","Julie, can you hold this for a second, thanks."
"Sorry, you had a paleontologist on your face. But, uh, it's gone now, you're alright.",Yeah?
Hi.,Hi everyone.
"Oh, God, no problem. So you're gonna go with the uh, waiting thing?","I just, I wanted to thank you for our uh, our little talk before."
"What did, what did he say?","Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey."
,"Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know. So I though about what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight so. . ."
Pop it in.,What's this in my pocket? Why it's Joey's porno movie.
"Great, people having sex, that's just what I need to see.","I'm fine with it, I mean, if you're OK watching a video filled with two nippled people."
"Well, well um, you know, these movies are offensive and uh, degrading to women and females. And uh, and the lighting's always unflattering. And, Monica help me out here.",What's wrong with people having sex?
"So is there like a story or do they just stard doing it right. . . oh, never mind.","Hell, I wanna see Joey."
"All I say is, she better get the job.","OK, now wait a minute. That is the craziest typing test I've ever seen."
"Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do. . . so I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line, you know that's bad fo r the paper tray.",Looks to me like he's the one getting the job.
"Thank you. Wait wait wait wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am. . .",Nice work my friend.
"So um, so what's up, you came to see me yesterday.",
Ohh. . .K. How come?,"Oh, yeah, um, alright, I kinda need a divorce."
What?,"Umm, actually, I'm getting married again."
Huuh.,"Oh God, I don't know how to tell you this. I'm straight."
"I, I don't, I don't understand, how can you be straight? I mean, you're, you're so smart and funny and you throw such great Academy Award parties.","Yeah, I know, I."
So how long have you known?,"I know, that's what I kept telling myself but you just reach a point where you can't live a lie anymore."
"And um, and there's actually a, a woman?","Well I guess on some level I always knew I was straight. I though I was supposed to be something else, you know, I'm an ice dancer, all my friends are gay, I was just tryin' to fit in."
"Oh. Well is she, is she the first that you've been with?",Her name's Debra.
Sure.,"Well, I've never told you this but, there were one or two times, back in college, when I'd get really drunk, go to a straight bar and wake up with a woman next to me. But I, I, I told myself it was the liquor and e-everyone experiments in college."
"I, I don't know what to say. I mean, you know, you're married to someone for six years and you think you know him and then one day says, 'Oh, I'm not gay.'","But now I know I don't have a choice about this, I was born this way."
Why couldn't you have just figured this out six years ago?,"I'm, I'm still me."
"You know, it still smells like monkey in there.",
"Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped.",That saves us a conversation.
"No, no, I mean, no, c'mon you guys, I mean, c'mon look it's only eleven thirty. Let's just talk, we never just hang out and talk anymore.","Me too, we should get goin'."
"Maybe that's all we do, what about Julie?","Rachel, that's all we do."
"Well, you have been in our lives for nearly two months now and we don't really know you. I mean, who is Julie? I mean, what do you like, what don't you like? We wanna hear everything.",What about Julie?
"So. I mean, who here does not have the time to get to know Julie?","Well, that could take a while."
I got time.,I got the time to get to know Julie.
"OK Julie, so now let's start with your childhood, what was that like?","Rach, I know her pretty well, can I go? That's fine."
"Nah, uh, uh, uh, uh.","Well, in a nutshell. . ."
"So, um, have you told your parents?",
"Here you go. You know what, I just have one more question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, I had been around, do you think that I would have been the one who. . . no, um, I'm sorry, don't tell me, I don't th ink either answer would make me feel better.","No, but it'll be OK, they're pretty cool, my brother's straight so. . ."
So your brother's straigh huh? Seriously.,I love you Phoebe.
"And my second grade teacher was Ms. Thomas, and my first grade teacher was Mrs. Cobb.",
"No Cobb, as in cobb salad.","Mrs., Mrs. Gobb?"
I'm goin' home.,"Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad?"
"Boy that Julie's a talker, huh?",What?
"So, it's pretty late, you're probably uh, not still planning on. . .",Goodnight.
"Oh, well, are hey, are you nervous?","Oh, no no, I am."
"Uh, OK, I mean uh, what, how are you gonna handle it. I mean, are, are ya gonna, are ya gonna talk about it before hand, are you just gonna pounce?","Um, no, I uh, I have done it before."
"OK, gook luck.","I uh, I don't know, I guess I'm just gonna see, see what happens."
"Nothing, I mean, um, it is your first time with her and, you know if the first time doesn't go well, well then that's, that's pretty darn hard to recover from.","Wha, uhh, what?"
Maybe you should put it off.,"OK, now I'm nervous."
"I know, yeah, sorry.","No, no, I don't wanna put it off, I just, God I just, I spent last year being so unbelievably miserable, ya know, and now, now I'm actually happy. You know, I mean, really happy. I just, I just don't wanna, I don't wanna mess it up, ya know."
"Maybe it, maybe it doesn't have to be this tough. I mean, maybe you were on the right track with this whole, you know, spontaneous thing. I mean, women really like that.","What, it's not your fault."
"Yeah, I mean, you know it, I mean, if it were me I, I, you know, I'd want you to, I don't know, like catch me off guard, you know, with like a really good kiss, you know really, sort of um, soft at first, then maybe um brush the hair away from my face, and look far into my eyes in a way that let's me know that something amazing is about to happen.",Really?
"And then, I don't know, I mean you'd pull me really close to you so that, so that I'd be pressed up, you know, right against you. And, um, it would get kind of sweaty and uh, and blurry, and then it's just happening.",Uh-huh.
"Ohh, God.","Ohh. . . Thanks Rach, goodnight."
Good morning.,
Twice.,"Well, somebody got some last night."
"Man, I sure miss Julie.",
You ever figure out what that thing's for?,"Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes, I see how you got there."
"Here comes the beep, you know what to do.","No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing. You know, I figure if I'm always answering the phone, people'll think I don't have a life. My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned."
What?,"Hello, I'm looking for Bob. This is Jane. I don't know if you're still at this number, but I was just thinking about us, and how great it was, and, well, I know it's been three years, but, I was kinda hoping we could hook up again. I barely had t he nerve to make this call, so you know what I did?"
Bob here.,I got a little drunk...and naked.
"Oh, you know, the usual, teaching aerobics, partying way too much. Oh, and in case you were wondering, those are my legs on the new James Bond poster.",What've you been up to?
I know.,Can you hold on a moment? I have another call. I love her.
"So, are we gonna get together or what?",I'm back.
"Great, I'll see you then.","Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?"
"Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, ""hey, you're not Bob.""",Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.
Oh my god. You are pure evil.,"I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table."
,"Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I've done this."
"Hi, Julie!","Yeah, yeah, everybody's here. Hey, everybody, say hi to Julie in New Mexico."
"Ok, while Ross is on the phone, everybody owes me 62 bucks for his birthday.","Hi, Julie."
"Hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert, and the cake.","Um, is, is there any chance that you're rounding up? You know, like from, like 20?"
"Look guys, I know it's a little steep.",Do we need a cake?
But it's Ross.,"Yeah, whoosh!"
All right.,It's Ross.
"Ok, sweetheart, I'll call you later tonight. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey, you're not really gonna go through with this, are you?","I'll see you guys later, I gotta go...do a thing."
"So uh, what are you guys doing for dinner tonight?","You know, I think I might just."
Can you believe how much this is gonna cost?,"Well I guess I gotta start savin' up for Ross's birthday, so I guess I'll just stay home and eat dust bunnies."
"Yes! Yeah, it's like they're always saying ""let's go here, let's go there"". Like we can afford to go here and there.","Do you guys ever get the feeling that um, Chandler and those guys just don't get that we don't make as much money as they do?"
For Ross.,"Yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice, you know? God, and it's not like we can say anything about it, 'cause, like this birthday thing, it's for Ross."
Oh my god.,"For Ross, Ross, Ross."
Hi.,Hey.
"I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti. All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office. It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.",What?
"Fortunately, it is me. And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much. Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate. You know, someplace nice.","If it's not you, this is a horrible story."
I'm tellin' you. You can't do this.,"Yeah, someplace nice. How much do you think I can get for my kidney?"
"That doesn't matter. She wanted to call Bob. Hey, for all we know, Bob is who she was meant to be with. You may be destroying two people's chance for happiness.","Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods."
Go over there and tell that woman the truth.,"We don't know Bob, ok? We know me. We like me. Please let me be happy."
Go.,All right.
Hi.,Hi.
Yes?,"Listen, I have to, uh, um, I have to, I have to confess something."
How did you--?,Whoever stood you up is a jerk.
Thanks.,"I don't know. I just had this weird sense. You know, but that's me. I'm weird and sensitive. Tissue?"
,"No, you keep the pack. I'm all cried out today."
Who is also in charge of purchasing.,"Ok, ok, here is to my sister, the newly-appointed head lunch chef--"
Who has her own little desk when Roland's not there.,Newly appointed head lunch chef who is also in charge of purchasing--
"Oh, wait, and I got a beeper!","Uh, lunch chef, purchasing, own little desk when Roland's not there. Here's to my little sister--"
Let's see!,Cool.
"Oh, sorry.","That's fine, I'll just wait!"
Monica!,"Sorry, sorry."
"Oh, you know what, we haven't even looked yet.",Are we ready to order?
"Wow, look at these prices.","Well, when you do, just let me know. I'll be right over there on the edge of my seat."
"What are these, like famous chickens?","Yeah, these are pretty ch-ching."
"Well, pretty incredible according to the message she left you on my machine. Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?","Hey, sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon. I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible was my afternoon with Jade?"
"Hey, tell me again, what do I do when Mr. Roper calls?","Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I couldn't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's number."
"Yes, I will start with the carpaccio, and then I'll have the grilled prawns.",Do I dare ask?
And for the gentleman?,That sounds great. Same for me.
"You'd think, wouldn't you? Miss?","Yeah, I'll have the Thai chicken pizza. But, hey, look, if I get it without the nuts and leeks and stuff, is it cheaper?"
And what will that be on the side of?,"Ok, I will have the uh, side salad."
And for you?,"Uh, I don't know. Why don't you put it right here next to my water?"
"I will have the uh, Cajun catfish.","Um, I'm gonna have a cup of the cucumber soup, and, um, take care."
"Yes, how 'bout a verse of Killing Me Softly. You're gonna sneeze on my fish, aren't you?",Anything else?
"Um, everyone?","Plus tip, divided by six. Ok, everyone owes 28 bucks."
Thank you.,"Oh, you're right, I'm sorry."
"Oh, thank you!","Monica's big night, she shouldn't pay."
"No, huh uh, no way, I'm sorry, not gonna happen.","So five of us is, $33.50 apiece."
"I'm sorry, Monica, I'm really happy you got promoted, but cold cucumber mush for thirty-something bucks? No! Rachel just had that, that, that salad, and, and Joey with his like teeny pizza! It's just...","Whoa, whoa, prom night flashback."
Not for you.,"Ok, Pheebs! How 'bout we'll each just pay for what we had. It's no big deal."
"Ok, look you guys, I really don't want to get into this right now. I think it'll just make everyone uncomfortable.","All right, what's goin' on?"
Yeah.,"Fine. All right, fine."
"Hello, it's us, all right? It'll be fine.",You can tell us.
Ok.,"Ok, um, uh, we three feel like, that uh, sometimes you guys don't get that uh, we don't have as much money as you."
We can talk about that.,I hear ya.
"I, I just never think of money as an issue.","Well, then...Let's."
That's a good point.,That's 'cause you have it.
"'Cause it's always somethin', you know, like Monica's new job, or the whole Ross's birthday hoopla.","So um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before?"
"Basically, there's the thing, and then there's the stuff after the thing.","Wha--? Whoa, hey, I don't want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negative--there's gonna be a hoopla?"
G-gift? The thing's not the gift?,"If it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing, and we'll just do the gift."
"Hootie and the--oh my. I, I can catch them on the radio.","No, the thing was, we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish."
"No, look, hey, it's my birthday, and the important thing is that we all be together.","No, now I feel bad. You wanna go to the concert."
Together.,All of us.
Ok.,Not at the concert.
Thank you.,Yeah.
Yeah.,Thanks.
,"So, the ebola virus. That's gotta suck, huh?"
"I don't know, Chandler. Let's take a look.","Gee, Monica, what's in the bag?"
"Why, it's dinner for six. 5 steaks, and an eggplant for Phoebe.","Oh, it's like a skit."
Cool.,Whoo!
"But wait, there's more. Hey, Chandler, what is in the envelope?","Yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys gave me the steaks as sort of a thank-you."
Come on.,"By the way, this didn't seem so dorky in the hall."
"It's on us, all right, so don't worry. It's our treat.","Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish! The Blowfish!"
Could you be less enthused?,So...Thank you.
Like?,"Look, it's a nice gesture, it is. But it just feels like--"
Charity?,Charity.
"Ross, you have to understand that your nice thing makes us feel this big.",We're just tryin' to do a nice thing here.
"I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.","Actually, it makes us feel that big."
"Oh, now you're tellin' us how you feel.","If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault. Maybe that's just how you feel."
"I'm just gonna pass on the concert, 'cause I'm just not in a very Hootie place right now.","Ok, we never shoulda talked about this."
Me too.,Me neither.
"Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff.","Guys, we bought the tickets."
"Well, I guess now we can't go.",Why did you look at me when you said that?
You know what? You're right.,"What? Come on, you do what you want to do. Do we always have to do everything together?"
Fine.,Fine.
Fine.,Fine.
All right. We're gonna go. It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.,Fine.
Yeah?,Chandler!
Yeah. Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today.,Geez! Are you ready?
"Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I was awesome, ok? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming.",Whoa! You had sex today?
"Now I know it's been awhile, but I took it as a good sign.",Wow.
I had sex today. I never have to answer that phone again.,Still doing the screening thing?
"Hey, Bob, it's Jade. Listen, I just wanted to tell you that I was really hurt when you didn't show up the other day, and just so you know, I ended up meeting a guy.","Here comes the beep, you know what to do."
"Oh, hi.",Bob here.
"Yes, yes, I did. In fact, I had sex with him 2 hours ago.","So, uh, you met someone, huh?"
Eh.,"So, uh, how was he?"
"Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.",Eh?
It was just so awkward and bumpy.,"Well, that makes me feel so good."
"Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with. And uh maybe you have to get used to it.",Bumpy?
,"Well there really wasn't much time to get used to it, you know what I mean?"
"Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.",You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.
"Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.","So, let's go."
"You know, the guys are probably having a great time.","Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now."
"Come on you guys, one more time.",
Nooo.,Ok. One.
"Excellent, that was excellent.",That was amazing!
"What guys? Oh, yeah.",I can't believe the guys missed this.
Do I know you?,"Excuse me, you're Monica Geller aren't you?"
"Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How've you been?",You used to be my babysitter.
You can't be a lawyer. You're eight.,"Good, good, I'm a lawyer now."
"Uh, wait, backstage?","Listen, it was nice to see you. I gotta run backstage."
Ross.,"Oh, yeah, my firm represents the band."
"How are you? Look, you guys wanna meet the group? Come on. So, are you one of the ones who fooled around with my dad?",Chandler.
"Hey, you guys.",
"Oh, thank you, thanks. So uh, how was your night last night?",Happy birthday.
"Yeah, ours pretty much sucked, oh, but, I did run into little Stevie Fisher. Remember him?","Oh, well, it pretty much sucked. How was yours?"
"Uh, good.","Oh yeah. I used to babysit him. Hey, how's his dad?"
"Yeah, we really missed you guys.","Uh, aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust."
"We just have to really, really, really, not let stuff like money get--is that a hickey?","Yeah, look, we were just saying, this whole thing is really stupid."
On someone's lips? Where'd you get the hickey?,"No, I just, I fell down."
What party?,"You know, a party, or--"
You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish?,"It wasn't so much a party as...a gathering of people, with food, and music, and, and the band."
Who gave you that hickey?,"Yes, apparently Stevie and the band are like this."
Oh!,That would be the work of a Blowfish.
"Look, don't blame us. You guys coulda been there, you know.","Oh! I can't believe it. I can't believe this. We're just like, sitting at home, trying to guess Joey's fingers, and you guys are out like partying and having fun, and you know, all, ""hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck""."
It's work.,"What, as part of your poor friends outreach program?"
And we don't work hard?,I don't know what to say. I'm sorry that we make more money than you. But we're not gonna feel guilty about it. We work really hard for it.
I'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.,"Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I just got a page."
Yes.,And you feel like we hold you back.
No.,Oh!
Oh.,"Leon, Leon. Shhh! Guys. Wait, I don't understand. Those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor. That was not a kick back. I'll just replace them and we can forget the whole thing. What corporate policy? No. Yeah. All right. I just got fired."
Let me get that. You got five bucks?,Here's your check. That'll be $4.12.
"Hi, it's me. Listen, Bob. I'm probably way out of line here. I mean, It has been 3 years, and you're probably seeing someone else now, but if we could just have one night together, just for old time's sake, one hot, steamy, wild night...","Here comes the beep, you know what to do."
"Who da wenny-Benny boy? You the Wenny-wenny-Benny-Benny boy, yes. Don't cry. Don't cry. Why is he still crying?",
Maye it's me.,Let me hold him for a sec. There. Huh? There we are.
"You know, I once dated a Miss Crankypants. Lovely girl, kinda moody.",Don't be silly. Ben loves you. He's just being Mr. Crankypants.
There's my little boy.,There we go. All better.
Cool.,Can I uh see something?
"Come on, don't do this.",He hates me. My nephew hates me.
"Monica, will you stop? This is nuts. Do you know how long it's gonna be before you actually have to deal with this problem? I mean, you don't even have a boyfriend yet. Joey, she does not look fat.",What if my own baby hates me? Huh? What am I gonna do then?
That is so funny. Let me see that.,"Goo, goo, goo, waaah!"
I don't know. What's in this pie?,"Are you ok, Ross?"
Kiwi? Kiwi? I thought it was a key lime pie.,"Uh, I don't know, butter, eggs, flour, lime, kiwi--"
And that's what's gonna kill me. I'm allergic to kiwi.,"No I didn't, I said kiwi lime. That's what makes it so special."
Ugh.,"No you're not. You're, you're allergic to lobster and peanuts and--oh my god."
Ugh. It's definitely getting worse.,Oh my god.
Either that or my mouth is getting smaller.,Is your tongue swelling up?
Is he gonna be ok?,"All right, get your coat, we're going to the hospital."
"You know, you know, actually it's getting better. It is. It is. Let's not go. Anyone for Thcrabble?","Yeah, he's just gotta get a shot."
What about Ben? We can't bring a baby to a hospital.,Jacket now.
I don't think tho.,We'll watch him.
"I was looking forward to playing basketball, but I guess that's out the window.","What? I have seven Catholic sisters. I've taken care of hundreds of kids. Come on, we wanna do it, don't we?"
"Hat, milk, got it.","Ok, well, if you do take him out for his walk, you might wanna bring his hat, and there's extra milk in the fridge, and there's extra diapers in the bag."
Consider it done.,??? Thro up a thro thro--a thro thro!
"Yeah, my uncle Sal has a really big tongue.",You understood that?
,Is he the one with the beautiful wife?
Ok.,"Hey Rach, wanna hear the new song I'm thinkin' of singing this afternoon? I wrote it this morning in the shower."
"Uh, Rachel, sweetheart, could I see ya for a minute?","I'm in the shower and I'm writing a song. Stop me if you've heard it. My skin is soapy, and my hair is wet, and Tegrin spelled backward is Nirget."
F.Y.I.. I've decided to pay a professional musician to play in here on Sunday afternoons. Her name is Stephanie... something. She's supposed to be very good.,What's up?
"Rachel, it's not that your friend is bad, it's that she's so bad, she makes me want to put my finger through my eye into my brain and swirl it around.",But what about Phoebe?
Uh--,"Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her."
"Lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, as needed.","Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her?"
"You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?",
"No, I got him.","It's gonna be worth it. It's a known fact that women love babies, all righ? Women love guys who love babies. It's that whole sensitive thing. Quick, aim him at that pack o' babes over there. Maybe one of them will break away. No, no wait, for get them, we got one, hard left. All right, gimme the baby."
"Oh, seriously you want him?","No, seriously."
Hello.,Hello.

I think it's great you guys are doing this.,What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you?
"You know, my brother and his boyfriend have been trying to adopt for three years. What agency did you two go through?","Well, we are great guys."
"But, but this is my gig. This is where I play. My, my name is written out there in chalk. You know, you can't just erase chalk.",
"And he's going to be paying this woman? Why doesn't he just give her like a throne, and a crown, and like a, you know, gold stick with a ball on top.","Honey, I'm sorry."
"Yeah, ok. You probably did everything you could.","Terry is a jerk, ok? That's why we're always saying ""Terry's a jerk!"" That's where that came from."
"I, I don't know.","Ok, you know what, lemme, let me just see what else I can do. All right, look, look. Why don't you just let her go on after Stephanie whatever-her-name-is. I mean, you won't even be here. You don't pay her. It's not gonna cost you anything."
You don't clean the cappuccino machine?,"Come on, Terry, I'll even clean the cappuccino machine."
"Oh, all right, fine, fine, fine.","Of course I clean it. I mean, I,I will cleeeean it. I mean, I will cleeeean it."

Well you said that he's paying the people who are playing.,What?
"Well, I'm not gonna be the only one who's not getting paid.","Oh, no, no no. I meant that he's gonna be paying that other woman beause she's a professional."
"No, huh uh, I'm sorry, no. No, I'm not some like sloppy second, charity band. You know what, there are thousands of places in this city where people would be happy to pay to hear me play. When I play, I play for me, I don't need your charity. Thank you! La la la la la la la....","Well, but Pheebs."
"Hello, there. I'm Dr. Carlin. I see someone's having an allergic reaction.","Well, there's no way I'm gonna get a shot. Maybe they can take the needle and thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun."
Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea?,"Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles."
"No, under these circumstances it has to be an injection, and it has to be now.","My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally."
Ohhh.,Tho?
Ok.,"That's good, have a seat. Um, the doctor says it's gotta be a needle. You're just gonna have to be brave, ok? Can you do that for me?"
"That's a good plan, Joe. Next time we wanna pick up women, we should just go to the park and make out. Taxi, taxi!","Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand? All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard. Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard! Oh, Ross! Let go of my hand!"
Just practicing. You're good. Carry on.,"Hey, hey, look at that talent."
"Ok, but can you tell him that, because he thinks he's too pink.","Hey, you. He's just adorable."

Ben! Ben! Ben!,Where's your baby?
Stop the bus! Wait! Wait! Wait!,"Oh, that's good. Maybe he'll hear you and pull the cord."
"No, it's just a good bone bruise. And, right here is the puncture wound from your ring.",Are you sure he didn't break it because it really hurts.
"... with the double double double-jointed boy. Hey. So um, are you the professional guitar player?","Oh, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. Sorry. Sorry! Hey! Hey! I got my s's back! Which we can celebrate later. Celebrate."

"Ok, do you know A minor?",Yeah.
"Ok, do you know how to go from D to A minor?",Yeah.
"Ok. Um, so does your guitar have a strap?",Yeah.
Oh. Mine does. Stephanie knows all the chords.,No.
"Hi, here's the deal. We lost a carseat on a bus today. It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller. Oh, and there was a baby in it. He wants to talk to you again.","Come on, pick up, pick up! Hello? Transit Authority? Yes, hello. I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus. Yes I do realize that would be a very stupid charact er."
"Terry's a jerk, and he won't let me work, and I hate Central Perk!","Ok, everybody, let's give a uh nice warm Central Perk welcome to--"
Thank you. I'd like to start with a song that I wrote for the first man I ever loved. Zachary.,"Uh, to Stephanie Schiffer."
Hi. We're the guys who called about the baby. We left the baby on ths bus. Is he here? Is he here?,You're all invited to bite me!
That's me.,He's here. I'm assuming one of you is the father.
"Actually, uh, we're both the father.",I'm him.
Please tell me you know which one is our baby.,"Oh, Ben! Hey, buddy!"
Ok.,"Well, well that one has ducks on his t-shirt, and this one has clowns. And Ben was definitely wearing ducks."
Yeah?,"Or clowns. Oh, oh wait. That one's definitely Ben. Remember, he had that cute little mole by his mouth."
"Hey, Ben, remember us? Ok, the mole came off.",Yeah.
What're we gonna do? What're we gonna do?,Ahh!
"Oh, we're gonna flip for the baby?","Uh, uh, we'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns."
"All right, call it in the air.",You got a better idea?
Heads it is.,Heads.
We have to assign heads to something.,Yes! Whew!
What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday?,"Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads."
Hey.,
Here. I thought you might be cold.,"Oh, hi."
"Whoa, look at you, you did pretty well.",Thank you.
Do you?,"Eight dollars and 27 cents. But not really, 'cause I put in the first two, just to, you know, get the ball rolling, and to make myself feel better."
"Well, you know, honey, I don't think everybody gets Smelly Cat. You know, I mean, if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then, whoosh!","No. This whole like playing-for-money thing is so not good for me. You know, I don't know, when I sang ""Su-Su-Suicide"", I got a dollar seventy-five. But then, ""Smelly Cat"", I got 25 cents and a condom. So you know, now I just feel really bad for Smelly Cat."
"Well, people missed you in there. And in fact, there was actually a request for ""Smelly Cat"".","It's not even that. I used to do my songs because it made me happy, but now it's like, it's just all about the money."
"Well, from me. And I know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite.",Really? From who?
Yeah. Here you go.,"Hi. Uh, did I accidentally drop a condom in your case? It's kind of an emergency."
,"Thanks a lot. Hey Christine, I got it!"
That's ok. I'm sorry I poisoned you.,"I just wanna thank you for being there for me today. And I'm sorry I,I almost broke your hand."
"Remember it? What do you think this is, a freckle?","Yeah. Hey, remember the time I jammed that pencil into your hand?"
"Wait, what about the time I hit you in the face with the Silvian's pumpkin?",Oh.
No. But I remember people telling me about it.,"Oh, man. Oh, remember when I stuck that broom in your bike spokes, and you flipped over and hit your head on the curb?"
Yeah. I hope she can kick his ass.,I hope Ben has a little sister.
That was you?,"I'm gonna get a new band-aid. Hey, how 'bout the time I cut the legs off your Malibu Ken?"
"Aw, my little nephew. Come here, little one. There's my little baby Ben. Hey, my little boy. Hey, he's not crying.","They, uh, were infected. He wouldn't have made it."
Yes! There's still pie.,"Hey, he's not crying."
"Oh, yeah, he rode the bus today.","I'm here. How's my little boy? Want Daddy to change your diaper? So, did you have fun with Uncle Joey and Uncle Chandler today?"
"You, you are gonna love this.","Ohhh. Big boy, riding the bus--Hey, I have a question. How come it says Property of Human Services on his butt?"
"Stay back, I've got kiwi. Run, Joey, Run!",Will you hold Ben for a sec? Come here. Come here.
"No, no, no. I'm sorry. It's ""smelly cat, smel-ly cat"".","Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?"

Mmmm hmmm.,Ok.
That's too much. Sorry.,"Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat, it's not your fault."
"OK, what is it about me? Do I not look fun enough? Is there something. . . repellant. . . about me?",
"Well it couldn't have been worse. A woman literally passed through me. OK, so what is it, am I hideously unattractive?","So, how was the party?"
"Woah, woah, I've put on a little weight?","No, you are not, you are very attractive. You know what, I go through the exact same thing. Every time I put on a little weight, I start questioning everyting."
"Chandler, I'm unemployed and in dire need of a project. Ya wanna work out? I can remake you.","No, not wieght... y'know, more like insulation."
Please.,"Oh, you know, I would, but that might get in the way of my lying around time."
"Alright, OK, alright. But if we put on spandex and my boobs are bigger than yours, I'm goin' home.",C'mon. Let her. Yeah.
,"Your boobs are fine. Look, I never should have said anything. Come here. Come here. Oh, can't make.... hands... meet...."
"Nothing, just never seen you in little stretchy pants before.","OK, let's do it. What?"

"Nope. Zilch, nothin', uh-uh.","The guy still won't put out, huh?"
"Look, I, y'know, I don't mind taking it slow, I like him a lot, y'know he's really interesting and he's really sweet and why won't he give it up?",Sorry Phoebs.
"No, whad'ya mean? He's not British.","Maybe he, uhh... drives his car on the other side of the road, if ya know what I mean."
"Oohh, um, no, I don't think that's the problem. 'Cause we went, um, dancing the other night and the way he held me so close, and the way he was looking into my eyes I just like... definitely felt something.",Maybe he's. . . gay.
"No, I felt it on my hip. You could tell.","Yeah, but how much can you tell from a look?"
"Joey, be a pal. Lift up my hand and smack her with it.","Yo, Bing. Racquetball in 15 minutes."
"What? C'mon you guys, I don't care, I have a date tonight.","Ooh, oh, Rachel, don't look."
"Yeah, Monica's settin' me up.","Woah, woah, woah, you have a date?"
"Oh what, my whole insane jealousy thing? Well, y'know, as much fun as that was, I've decided to opt for sanity.","But uh, uh, what about uh, Ross and uh. . .?"
"Oh yeah, c'mon, I'm movin' on. He can press her up against that window as much as he wants. For all I care, he can throw her through the damn thing.",So you really OK about all this?
Hey.,Hi guys.
Only if you say his full name.,"Oh, Monica, I figured I'd come by tomorrow morning and pick up Fluffy's old cat toy, OK?"

"Yeah, we figure it'll live with Ross half the time, and with me half the time.",Together.
Hopefully.,"Ohh, well, isn't that just lovely. That's something the two of you will be able to enjoy for a really, really, really, really, really long time."
,"Well. Woah, look at that! I gotta go, I gotta date. With a man. Um, OK, you guys have a really, uh, have a really good night and you two have a, uh, have a, uh, really good cat. OK, we're not supposed to take these when we leave."
How long do cats live?,"I don't know if Monica told you but this is the first date I've gone on since my divorce so, if I seem a little nervous, I am."
"Cats, how long do they live figuring you don't... y'know, throw 'em under a bus or something?",I'm sorry?
That's just great.,"Um, maybe 15, 16 years."
"Oh, right, clink.","Um, cheers."
"Oh, no, Michael, it's not you. I'm sorry, it's just, it's this thing. It's probably not as bad as it sounds but this friend of mine is, is getting a cat with his girlfriend.","Monica told you I was cuter that this, didn't she?"
I mean he just started going out with her.,"Oh, that does sound. . .Ahh."
"Ah, hah-hah-hah-ho, yeah, he wishes. Oh, I'm sorry, look at me. OK, Michael, let's talk about you.","Is this guy, uhh, an old boyfriend?"
"OK, OK. So, you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?",Alright.
"So, I figured it out.",
Why Scott doesn't want to sleep with me. It's 'cause I'm not sexy enough.,What?
"Really? That's so sweet. I mean, I'm officially offended but, sweet.","Phoebe, that's crazy. When I first met you, you know what I said to Chandler? I said, ""Excellent butt, great rack."""
"You're right, you're right. Ah, you are so yumm.","Phoebs look, if you want to know what the deal is, you're just gonna have to ask him."
"I mean, it's a cat, y'know, it's a cat. Why can't they get one of those bugs, y'know, one of those fruitflies, those things that live for like a day or something? What're they called, what're they called, what're they called?",
Yes! Thank you.,Fruitflies?
"No! No dessert, just a check, please.","So, would you like any dessert?"
"No, no, I am, but only because for the last hour and a half I've been playing the movie Diner in my head.","Oh, you're not having fun, are you?"
"Oy. Look, I've been through a divorce, trust me you're gonna be fine. You just can't see it now because you haven't had any closure.","Oh, look at me, look at me. Oh, I'm on a date with a really great guy, all I can think about is Ross and his cat and his... Julie. I just want to get over him. gosh, why can't I do that?"
"Well, you know, there's no one way really, it's just, you know, whatever it takes so that you can finally say to him, ""I'm over you.""","Yeah! Closure. That's what it is, that's what I need. God, you're brilliant! Why didn't I think of that? How do I get that?"
Hang on.,"Closure, that's what it is. Closure. Hello, excuse me. Excuse me, hel. . . woo"
What.,"Hello, excuse me."
I'm talkin'!,"Hi, I'm sorry, I need to borrow your phone for just one minute."
"Alright, fine. I'll call you back.","I can see that. I... just one phone call, I'll be very quick, I'll even pay for it myself. OK, you're bein' a little weird about your phone."
Good.,Thank you. OK. Machine. Just waiting for the beep.
,"Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat who, by the way, I think you should name Michael. And, you know, ya see there I'm thinking of names so obviously, I am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure."
Why not?,"No, no, no, no, no, no No. Monica, it's Sunday morning. I'm not running on a Sunday."
"OK, if you say stop, then we stop.",Because it's Sunday. It's God's day.
"No, c'mon, we can't stop, c'mon, we've got three more pounds to go. I am the energy train and you are on board. Woo-woo, woo-woo, woo-woo Woo.","OK, stop."
Hey Rach.,
Oh. And how was the date?,Ahhhh.
"Wow, well uh, uh, actually, Julie's downstairs getting a cab, I just need the cat toy, did Monica say. . . What? Why, why are you looking at me like that?","Umm, I think there was a restaurant... I know there was wine. . ."
"OK. Oh, oh, oh.","I don't know, I, I feel like I had a dream about you last night but I, I don't remember."
"No, I stayed at Julie's last night.",Did we speak on the phone last night? Did you call me?
"Oh, actually I haven't even been home yet. Do you mind if I check my messages?",Huh.
"Rach, I got a message from you. Who's Michael?","Oh yeah, go ahead."
You're over me?,"Oh my God. Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the. . ."
"Wha... you're uh, you're, you're over me?",Ohhhhhhhh God.
"When, when were you... under me? Rach. Rachel do you, I mean, were you, uh. . . What?","Ohh, ohh."
You've had feelings for me?,"Ohh, OK, OK, OK, well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you."
"Woah. Huh. You know about my, I mean, you know I had... you know?","Yeah, what, so? You had feelings for me first."
Chandler. When did he... when did he... when did he?,Chandler told me.
China.,When you were in China.
"Julie. Julie. That. Oh God. Julie, right. OK, I need to lie down. No, ya know, I'm gonna stand. I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna walk, I'm walkin' and I am standing. OK so you uh, and now wha... and now, now, now you're over me?",Meeting Julie.
"That's, that's Julie. Ju... Julie, Julie. Hi Julie.",Are you over me?
I'll be right down.,"Hi honey, I've got a cab waiting."
"Well, OK, I uh, I have to. I can't deal with this right now. I mean, I've uh, y'know, I've got a cab, I've got a girlfriend, I'm... I'm gonna go get a cat.","Wait, so, you're going?"
Cat.,"OK, OK."
Hey Joey.,
How come you're watching a rabbi play electric guitar?,Hey Phoebs.
"So, Scott asked me to come over for lunch today and I did.",I can't find the remote. Thank you.
And we did.,And?
Yay me.,"All right Phoebs, way to go."
"Well, I finally took your advice and asked him what was going on.","So, so how did it happen?"
"He said that, um, he understands how sex can be like, a very emotional thing for a woman and he was just afraid that I was gonna get all, y'know, like, 'ohh, is he gonna call me the next day' and, y'know, 'where is this going' and, ya know, blah-la-la-la-la. So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious.",And what did he say?
"Yeah, so I said, ""OK, relax please,"" y'know, I mean, sex can be just about two people right there in the moment, y'know, it's, if he wants to see me again he can call and if not, that's fine too. So after a looooot of talking. . . I convinced him.",Wow.
Um-hum.,"Let me get this straight. He got you to beg to sleep with him, he got you to say he never has to call you again, and he got you thinking this was a great idea."
,This man is my God.
I didn't get a cat.,Hi.
"No, no it's not interesting. OK, it's very, very not interesting. In fact it's actually 100 percent completely opposite of interesting.","Oh, that's um, interesting."
You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.,"Alright, I got it Ross."
I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.,What?
Then you should have said something before I met her.,"Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?"
There was never a good time.,I didn't know then. And how come you never said anything to me.
"Not, not, not every night. You know, and... and it's not like I didn't try, Rachel, but things got in the way, y'know? Like, like Italian guys or ex-fiances or, or, or Italian guys.","Right, you, you only had a year. We only hung out every night."
"The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed.","Hey, there was one Italian guy, OK, and do you even have a point?"
"Hey, I've been doin' it since the ninth grade, I've gotten pretty damn good at it.","Yeah, what're you saying, you just sort of put away feelings or whatever the hell it was you felt for me?"
Fine.,"Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross."
Good.,'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.
"And ya know what, now I've got closure.",Good.
,Try the bottom one.
"No way, with one pound to go, c'mon. We're workin', we're movin', we're in the zone we're groovin'.","Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning. We're not working out, it's over."
"Ooh, what'cha gonna do, fat boy, huh? What?","OK, I don't, I don't mind the last pound. OK, in fact I kind of like the last pound. OK, so don't make me do anything that I'll regret."
"Well, thanks.","Nothing, except tell you, uh, I think it's wonderful how much energy you have."
"Well, you know.","I mean, especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work."
Uh-huh.,"You know, I mean, you can't tell your parents you were fired because they'd be disappointed."
"Well no, but um.",And it's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.
"Y'know, I try to stay positive. . .","I mean, if it were me, I think I'd have difficulty just getting out of bed at all."
Alright.,"So, you feel like goin' for a run?"
OK. Just for a little while.,"Because, you know, you don't have to. If you want, you could just take a nap right here."
,OK.
"Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!",Ross kissed me.
"Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!",It was unbelievable!
"Oh, it ended very well.","Ok, all right. We want to hear everything. Monica, get the wine and unplug the phone. Rachel, does this end well or do we need to get tissues?"
Do not start without me. Do not start without me.,Oh.
"Well, at first it was really intense, you know. And then, oh, god, and then we just sort of sunk into it.","Ok, all right, let's hear about the kiss. Was it like, was it like a soft brush against your lips? Or was it like a, you know, a ""I gotta have you now"" kind of thing?"
"No, actually first they started on my waist. And then, they slid up, and then, they were in my hair.","Ok, so, ok, was he holding you? Or was his hand like on your back?"
,Ohhhh.
Tongue?,"And, uh, and then I kissed her."
Cool.,Yeah.
"All right, check out this bad boy. 12 megabytes of ram. 500 megabyte hard drive. Built-in spreadsheet capabilities and a modem that transmits at over 28,000 b.p.s.",
Games and stuff.,Wow. What are you gonna use it for?
"Wait, here's one. Uh, would you be willing to cook naked?",There are no jobs. There are no jobs for me.
"No, but if you're willing to cook naked, then you might be willing to dance naked. And then...",There's an ad for a naked chef?
"Hey, oh, so, um...how'd you make out last night?",Hi.
Wait a minute. I thought last night was great.,"That, that is funny. That is painfully funny. No, wait. Wait, yeah, that's just painful"
You got all that from saline solution?,"Yeah, it was, but...I get home, ok, and I see Julie's saline solution on my night table. And I'm thinking to myself, oh my god, what the hell am I doing? I mean, here I am, I am with Julie, this incredible, great woman, who I care about and who cares about me, and I'm like, what, am I just gonna throw all that away?"
"Believe me, I've been dreaming about me and Rachel for ten years now. But now, I'm with Julie, so it's like me and Julie, me and Rachel, me and Julie, me and... ... Rachel. Rachel, Rachel.",We are talking about Rachel here. You and Rachel.
How are you?,"Hey, you."
Good.,Good. How are you?
"Hi, Julie. Hi, Julie. Julie, um, how are you?","Hi, honey."
"Good, so everybody's here. Everybody's good. So, were you gonna play something, Phoebe?",Good.
Play it.,"Oh, well, actually."
"Hey, Julie, I didn't know you wore lenses.","Ok, all right."
Ssshh.,What?
"There was a girl, we'll call her Betty, and a guy let's call him Neil. Now I can't stress this point too strongly, this story isn't real. Now our Neil must decide, who will be the girl that he casts aside. Will Betty be the one who he loves truly? Or will it be the one who we'll call Ju...Loolie? He must decide, he must decide, even though I made him up, he must decide!","Ok, um, hi, hello, hi, ok, so, um, this is a song about a love triangle between three people that I made up. Um, it's called, um, ""Two of Them Kissed Last Night""."
"This is a nice resume. Nice, nice, nice. Muy impressivo.",
Mockolate.,"So, Mr. Rastatter, what exactly does this job entail? The ad wasn't too clear."
Mockolate. It's a completely synthetic chocolate substitute.,I'm sorry?
"Go ahead. Try a piece. Yeah, we think that Mockolate is even better than chocolate.",Ohh.
Yeah?,All right. Mmm-mmm.
"No, ma'am. Well, anyhoo, we should be getting our F.D.A. approval any day now, hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving. See, the way we look at it, chocolate already dominates most of your major food-preparation holidays: Easter, Christmas, what have you.","I love how it crumbles. Now see, your chocolate doesn't do that."
"But, we're thinking, given the right marketing, we can make Thanksgiving the Mockolate holiday.",Mmm-mmm.
Aren't you going to swallow that?,Wow.
"Yeah, isn't that great?",Just waiting for it to stop bubbling.
"Well, anyhoo, um, we are looking for a couple of chefs who can create some Thanksgiving-themed recipes. You think you might be interested?",Mmm.
Really?,"Abso... ...lutely. See, I love creating new recipes. I love Thanksgiving. And, well, now, I love Mockolate."
,"Especially the after taste, you know, I'll tell ya, that'll last ya till Christmas."
"It's not, it's not very Thanksgiving-y.",How about Mockolate mousse?
What makes it pilgrim?,"Ok, how about pilgrim Mockolate mousse?"
Hey.,We'll put buckles on it.
Hey.,Hey.
"No, I'm sorry.","Did uh, Ross call?"
"No offense, but that sounds nothing like her.","Why didn't he call? He's gonna stay with Julie, isn't he? He's gonna stay with her and she's going to be all, ""Hi, I'm Julie, Ross picked me, and we're gonna to get married, have a lot of kids and dig up stuff together."""
"I don't know what to do. What am I gonna do? I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare.",
"Hey, here's a thought, Ross.","Oh, I know. This must be so hard. Oh, no. Two women love me. They're both gorgeous and sexy. My wallet's too small for my fifties, and my diamond shoes are too tight."
"Ross, listen. I got two words for you. Threesome.",Don't touch the computer. Don't ever touch the computer.
Can't we just use a pen?,"Ok, all right, look. Let's get logical about this, ok? We'll make a list. Rachel and Julie, pros and cons. Oh. We'll put their names in bold, with different fonts, and I can use different colors for each column."
"Ok, let's start with the cons, 'cause they're more fun. All right, Rachel first.","No, Amish boy."
You could say that.,"I don't know. I mean, all right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes."
Waitress. Got it. You guys wanna play Doom? Or we could keep doing this. What else?,"And I guess, you know, sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know. And I've seen her be a little too into her looks. Oh, and Julie and I, we have a lot in common 'cause we're both paleontologists, but Rachel's just a waitress."
"Oh, her ankles are a little chubby.",I don't know.
She's not Rachel.,"Ok, let's do Julie. What's wrong with her?"
"Ok, this is pumpkin pie with mockolate cookie crumb crust. This is mockolate cranberry cake, and these are mockolate chip cookies. Just like the Indians served.",
Oh my god good?,Oh my god.
"Oh, oh sweet Lord! This is what evil must taste like!","Oh my god, I can't believe you let me put this in my mouth."
"I'm telling you this thing won't print. Yes, I pressed that button like 100 times. You know, for a hot line you are not so hot. What? What is that in the background? Are you watching Star Trek?",
"Yes, it was horrible. She cried. I cried. She threw things, they hit me. Anyway, I did the right thing.","Hey, so how'd it go with Julie? Did you, did you break her heart?"
"Hey, do you guys have... ...hi.","So, Spock actually hugs his father?"
Where you goin'?,Hi.
Oh.,"I uh, I just got back from uh, from Julie's."
"Well, what's the other thing, what do I think?","No, no, uh, it's not what you think. It's um the other thing."
"He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes.","Well, uh."
"Really. It's always been you, Rach.",Really?
Ohhh.,"Oh, god."
"I know, I know, it's, it's almost... What do you say we go take a walk, just us, not them?","Oh, oh, this is good, this is really good."
"Ok. No, hey, whoa, whoa, I'll get your coat.",Let me get my coat.
What? Nothing.,"Ok, he's goin' to get my coat. He's goin' to get my coat. Oh my god, you guys. I can't believe this. This is unbelievable. What's that?"
"No, no, see? See? Hey, it's printing. Hey, it's printing!",What's that? What? I saw my name. What is it?
"Hey, someone order a coat?",Well what is it? Let me see.
"He won't? He won't! Because, isn't that, isn't that the, the short story you were writing?","Ross, Chandler wrote something about me on his computer and he won't let me see."
And I'm in it? Then let me read it.,"Yes, yes it is, short story, that I was writing."
Come on.,No!
"Alright. ""It was summer, and it was hot. Rachel was there. A lonely gray couch. 'Oh, look,' cried Ned, and then the kingdom was his forever. The end.""","Hey, uh, why don't you read it to her?"
"All right, you know what? This isn't funny anymore. There's something about me on that piece of paper and I want to see it.",That's it? That's all you wrote? You're the worst writer in the whole world.
"All right, you know what, that's fine. If you guys want to be children about this, that's fine. I do not need to see it.","No, you don't."
Good luck.,"What is this? Ross, what is this?"
Kind of ditzy? Too into her looks? Spoiled?,"Ok, just, just remember how crazy I am about you, ok?"
Just a waitress?,"Now that's a little spoiled. He was supposed to type ""little"", the idiot."
Oh! I do not have chubby ankles!,"No, that, that was, I mean, as opposed to uh, the uh, ok. Is this over yet Rach?"
She is not Rachem. What the hell's a Rachem? Is that some stupid paleontology word that I wouldn't know because I'm just a waitress.,"No, no, wait, ok, ok, look at the other side. Look at Julie's column."
,"No, Rach, come on. Rach! Rach, no, no! She's not Rachel, she is, she is not, Ra--Rachel?"
"You know, that's true. You'd be a great person to have around the day after an emergency.","My diary! My diary, that's brilliant. I should have told her it was my diary, she never would have made me read her my diary."
"Hey, cut him some slack. It was Chandler's idea.",I... I cannot believe Ross even made this list. What a dinkus.
What?,What?
This was your idea?,"Oh good, I was hoping that would come up."
"All right, let's get some perspective here, ok? These things, they happen for a reason.",What were you thinking?
"All right, Pheebs, back me up here, ok? You believe in that karma crap, don't you?",Yeah. You!
,"Yeah, by the way, good luck in your next life as a dung beetle."
"When somebody does not buzz you in, Ross, that means go away. That doesn't mean please climb up the fire escape.","Rach! Whoops! Rach, hey, open up, please!"
Not interested.,I just wanna read something. It's your pro list.
Number six: the way you smell.,"Ok, ok, number one: The way you cry at game shows. Number two: how much you love your friends. Number three: the way you play with your hair when you're nervous. Number four: how brave you are for starting your life over. Number five: how great you are with Ben."
"Hey, Joey. You wanna open the window?","Hey, Ross! What are you doin'?"
What are you doing out there?,"Oh, yeah, I do."
"Oh, you must be freezing. You know what you need? How about a nice steaming cup of hot Mockolate?","I am, uh, I am..."
No.,"Rach, come on, open up. Rach, come on, come on, Rach. You got to give me another chance."
That's what I said.,No?
"No, you guys, you really don't have to go, we're done talking.","Look, maybe we should go?"
"No, you don't, Ross. Imagine the worst things you think about yourself. Now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world not only thinks them too, but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you.","Rach, come on, look, I know how you must feel."
"Oh, well, that's, that's mighty big of you, Ross. I said don't go!","No, but, but I wanna be with you in spite of all those things."
"Well, then, I guess that's the difference between us. See, I'd never make a list.","You know what? You know what? If, things were the other way around, there's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you."
,"I never know how long you're supposed to wait in this type of a situation before you can talk again, you know? Maybe a little longer."
Doesn't matter.,"Now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh, like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars. I've indicated four cups of coconut, and four cups of crushed nut, and only, uh, one tablespoon of mockolate."
Our FDA approval didn't come through. Something about laboratory rats.,What?
"Yeah, well, anyhoo, here is your check. Thank you for all the trouble you went through. Um, listen, you didn't eat a lot of it while you were cooking, did you?","Oh, gosh, I'm sorry."
"Oh, some, that's fine. Some is fine. Some is not a lot. So, it doesn't burn when you pee, does it?","Well, uh, I ate some."
,
Hi.,Hello?
"Listen, I... I don't think this is the best time.","Is that him again? Tell him I'd come to the phone, but my ankles are weighin' me down."
"Sure, what? Ok, ok. Music?","Look, can, can you do something for me?"
"Uh, we've just gotten a call from Rachel, and she told us what Ross did. It's pretty appalling, and Ross, if you're listening, I don't wanna play your song anymore. Why don't we devote our time to a couple that stands a chance? Avery, Michelle's sorry she hit you with her car and she hopes you two will work it out.","The next one's dedicated to Rachel from Ross. Rachel, he wants you to know he's deeply sorry for what he did and he hopes you can find it in your heart to forgive him."
"Hi, thanks for coming in again.",
"It's like I'm lookin' in a mirror. Anyway, they're called ""fishtachios"". They taste exactly like pistachios, but they're made primarily of reconstituted fish bits. Here, try one. You're not allergic to anything, are you?","Oh, not at all. I have no morals and I need the cash."
"Oh, sorry.",Cat hair.
"Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Ugly Naked Guy is decorating his tree. Oh my God, you should see the size of his Christmas Balls.",
Hey.,Hey.
"Hey, how much did you guys tip the super this year?",Hey.
"Oh, actually this year we just made him homemade cookies.","Yeah, we were gonna give fifty, but if you guys gave more, we don't wanna look bad."
You gave him cookies?,And twenty-five it is.
I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick.,"Money is so impersonal. Cookies says someone really cares. . . Alright, we're broke, but cookies do say that."
"Not especially. But you know what, I think they had pot in them.","Phoebs, let me ask you something, were, were these, uh, funny brownies?"
"Uhh, the mailman, the super.","So you guys, who else did you tip with cookies?"
Oh my God.,"Oh, and the newspaper delivery guy."
"Uhhh, I don't think you're gonna like this.",What?
"Oh look, and he did my crossword puzzle.","Ooh, goooosh, ooh, these are cookies smashed in the sports section."
,"Yeah, but not very well, unless 14-across, 'Gershwin musical' actually is bitemebitemebitemebiteme."
Which is why geese are so relaxed this time of year.,"I can't believe it's Christmas already. Ya know, I mean, one day your eatin' turkey, the next thing ya know, your lords are a-leapin' and you geese are a-layin'."
Hey.,Hey guys.
Horrible and degrading list of reasons not to be with me?,"Hey Rach. I, uh, got you a little present. . . I'll open it. It's a Slinky! Remember, huh. Walks down stairs, alone or in pairs, everyone knows it's. . . just a big spring. Alright, you still mad at me becuase of the whole. . ."
Yeah.,"How 'bout from now on we just call it the 'unfortunate incident'? Hey Gunther, you got stairs in your place?"
Hey guys.,"Here, go nuts."
What's in the bag?,Hey.
C'mon show us what you bought. . . You know you want to.,"Um, just some presents."
Cute.,"OK. OK, this is a picture frame from Ben to my parents, huh."
"Ross, that is gorgeous!","I got some, uh, hers and hers towels for Susan and Carol. And, uh, I got this blouse for mom."
"Look at these authentic fake medals. I tell ya, mom's gonna be voted best dressed at the make-believe military academy.",Yeah?
Hey. Hi Phoebe.,Hey.
"Uh, Macy's, third floor, home furnishings.","Happy Christmas Eve Eve. Oh my God, where did you get this?"
"Nah, Phoebs, that's the guy that comes in the frame.","This is my father, this is a picture of my dad."
"Phoebe, I thought your dad was in prison.","No it isn't, this is my dad, alright, I'll show you."
How have you never been on Oprah?,"No, that's my stepdad. My real dad's the one that ran out on us before I was born."
"Honey, uh, this is a picture of the frame guy posing in front of a bright blue screen with a collie.","OK, look, see, this is him. My mother gave me this picture before she died, same guy."
"Oh, wait a minute honey.","It's not a blue screen... it's just, maybe it was just really clear that day. OK, I have to talk to my grandmother."
Wow.,Phoebs.
Joey!,"So anyway, I'm trying to get my boss's ex-wife to sleep with me. . ."
,"Oh, but when Phoebe has a problem, everyone's all ears!"
"Hi, Phoe.",Esther Livingston. Gone.
"Oh, just updating the phonebook.",Hi Gram. Whatcha doin'?
"Oh. Oh, sure, sure, uh, uh, how come?","Um, gram, um, can I see the pictures of my dad again?"
"Oh, sure, yeah. This is the one of you father in a meadow, and, uh, helping a little boy fly a kite, and here he is at a graduation. . . another graduation. . . another graduation.","Just, you know, to see... um."
Is it really your fa--I can't... well of course it is.,"OK, is this really my father?"
"Look, I. . .","OK, I smell smoke. Maybe that's 'cause someone's pants are on fire."
"Alright, that is not your father, that's just a picture of a guy in a frame.","Ya know, in all the years that we have been grandmother and granddaughter, you have never lied to me."
"It was your mother's idea. Ya know, she didn't want you to know your real father because it hurt her so much when he left, and, I didn't want to go along with it, but, well then she died and, and it was harder to argue with her. Not impossible, but harder.",Oh God.
"Last I heard, he was a pharmacist somewhere upstate.","Alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? And then, I guess, OK, he doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones?"
Honey.,"OK, that makes no sense. Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist?"
"Anyway, that's all I know. That, and this. This is the real him.",Oh.
,Oh.
"Well, that doesn't sound like a very merry Christmas.","Ya know I remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big black boots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs. He didn't want anybody to see him but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up."
Hi.,Who said anything about Christmas?
"No, nothin'.","Hey, anyone hear from Phoebe yet?"
"Yeah, I know exactly what she's goin' through.",I hope she's OK.
She told us.,How do you know exactly what she's going through?
Just some stuff for the party.,So whaddya got there Monica?
"You guys haven't gotten your presents yet? Tomorrow's Christmas Eve, what're ya gonna do?","Yeah, what're you guys doin' here, aren't you supposed to be Christmas shopping?"
"Oh, by the way Mon, I don't think the mailman liked your cookies. Here are the ornaments your mom sent.",Don't you have to be Claymation to say stuff like that?
"Monica, pigeons learn faster that you.","Well, maybe the mailman liked the cookies, we just didn't give him enough."
"Wha... forget it Ross, no, I am not gonna stand here and make a list of. . .","Hey, Rach, you know what? I think, I think I know what'll make you feel better. How 'bout you make a list about me."
"OK, you're whiney, you are, you're obsessive, you are insecure, you're, you're gutless, you know, you don't ever, you don't just sort of seize the day, you know. You like me for what, a year, you didn't do anything about it. And, uh, oh, you wear too much of that gel in your hair.",C'mon Rachel.
"Yeah, and you know what? You're right, I do feel better, thank you Ross.","See there, you uhh, alright, ya, you did what I said."
"Yeah, um, in Albany, can I have the number of Frank Buffay. . . OK, um, in Ithica. . . alright, um, Saratoga. . . Oneonta. Alright, you know what, you shouldn't call youself information.",
"Hello grandma, if that is in fact your real name.",Hey.
"Well, not so good. Upstate's pretty big, he's pretty small, you do the math.","C'mon now Phoe, don't still be mad at me. How's it going?"
"No I just, just wanted to know who he was, ya know.","Well, I think you're better off without him. Oh honey, I know he's your daddy but, but to me he's still the irresponsible creep who knocked up your mom and stole her Gremlin."
Whattaya mean?,"I know. OK, I wasn't completely honest with you when I told you that, uh, I didn't know exactly where he lived."
Wow. Thank you.,"He lives at 74 Laurel Drive in Middletown. If you hit the Dairy Queen, you've gone too far. You can take my cab."
"Uh-huh, got it. Ooh, I'm gonna see my dad. Wish me luck, Grandpa! Commercial","Now, remember, nobody else drives that cab."
Phoebe here with the cab yet?,
"Well she better get here soon, the outlet stores close at 7.","Yeah, she, she brought the invisible cab. . . hop in."
"Hey, here she comes.","Hey, don't worry. I figure it'll be 2 hours to Phoebe's dad's house, they'll meet, they'll chat, they'll swap life stories, we'll still have plenty of time."
Hey.,Hey.
Hey.,Hey.
Eeeshk.,"Can you believe this. In, like, two hours I'm gonna have a dad. Eeeshk."
"OK, let's go.","Yeah, big stuff."
"Alright, here, you have to hold this.",OK.
"Uh-huh, yeah, that's my cheat sheet.","OK. Brake left, gas right?"
"Oh, no no, that side doesn't have one, the paramedics had to cut through it.",Where's my seat belt?
Hey.,Hey!
"C'mon, just tell me, please, please.",
"Oh, gosh, it's hot in here.","For the sixteenth time, no... I do not think you're obsessive."
"Sure. By the way, there's a difference between being obsessive and. . .","Rach, get the heat. Ross, could you turn the heat down please?"
"Fine, OK! Heat, heat, heat, and I'm the obsessive one. OK, this way is on, so this is. . . off.","Ross, the heat!"
"No, no, I was turnin' the knob and, and. . . here it is.",Did you just break the radiator?
"It uhh, it won't go back.",Well put it back.
"Here, let me try.",I'll call the super.
"Hey, it's Funny's cousin, Not Funny.","Oh, oh that's right, I forgot about your ability to fuse metal."
"OK, tip the man.","Hi, Mr. Treeger. Hi, it's Rachel Green from upstairs. Yes, somebody, uh, broke our knob on the radiator and it's really hot in here. Yes, it's, it's hot enough to bake cookies. Well, do you think we could have a new one by 6? Wha t, no, no, Tuesday, we can't wait until Tuesday, we're having a party tonight."
"Hey, here's a theme: Come on in, live like bacon.","No, if he doesn't like our cookies, too bad, I am not gonna be blackmailed. Look if worse comes to worse, it gets a little warm, we'll call it a theme party."
"Ooh, this is it, 74.",
"Wow, this is it, I'm gonna meet my dad. This is like the biggest thing ever, huh.","Oh, so that's what this is for."
Sure is.,Yeah.
Alright.,"OK, here I go. I'm goin' in."
"OK, here I go. . . here I go. . . I'm goin'.",Good luck Phoebs.
"Hi, welcome to our tropical Christmas party. You can put your coats and sweaters and pants and shirts in the bedroom.",
"Ice, ice, ice squares anyone? Take a napkin. Alright.","It's hard to tell because I'm sweating, but I use exactly what the gel bottle says, an amount about the size of a pea. How, how can that be too much?"
"Really? I'm perfectly comfortable. Hey, hey, hey, get in line buddy, I was next.","Monica, Monica, your guest are turning into jerky, OK."
"Uhh, you said there was a party.",Mr. Treeger.
"Ahh, is it hot? My body always stays cool, probably 'cause I have so much skin. Hey, cheese!","Oh, yeah, well hey, welcome to our sauna."
"No, I will not cave.","Alright, alright, here's the chance. Monica give him cash, Rachel give him your earrings. Something, now, anything."
"Alright, alright, you know how you say I never seize the day? Well, alright, even though he's your super, I'm seizing. Mr. Treeger, here is 50 bucks, merry Christmas.","Yeah, I'm with Mon."
"No no, no, that, that's your Christmas tip, alright. Oh, hey, do you think there's a chance you could fix that radiator now?","Oh wow, I didn't get you anything. Here's five back."
Ross.,"No can do, like I told the girl, I can't get a new knob until Thursday."
Looks like he's playin' baseball.,Yeah.
Whatever.,You mean hardball?
"Excuse me, I'm seizing. Mr. Treeger, here's another 50, happy Hanukkah. Will uh, will this help with the knob getting?",What'cha gonna' do?
"So, wait, you really did like my cookies?","No, the place is not open 'till Tuesday. Am I not saying it right."
Nice seizing. . . gel boy.,"Oh, yeah, they were so personal, really showed you cared."
"Huh-huh, no act--no, uhh, that, that is basil.","So, uh, is this, uh, mistletoe?"
"Huh-hoo, yeah, no, it's still basil.","Ahh, if it was mistletoe, I was gonna kiss ya."
OK.,
Mailbox.,How far'd ya get?
Uh-huh.,"Alright, we're gettin' closer."
"No, it's just like, ya know, it's a whole mess of stuff, ya know. It's like, yesterday, ya know, my dad was this, like, famous Burma tree surgeon guy and, ya know, now he's a, a pharmacist guy and. . .","Phoebs, what's goin' on?"
"Yeah, maybe, yeah. You know, and, and I'll knock on the door and, and he'll hug me and I'll have a dad. Ya know and I'll, I'll go to his pharmacy and everyone will be really nice to me 'cause, you know, I'm Franks daughter.","Well, maybe he's, maybe he's this really cool pharmacist guy."
"Well, 'cause, I mean, what if, what if he's not this great dad guy? I mean, what if, what if he's just still the dirtbag who ran out on my mom and us? You know what? I've already lost a fake dad this week and I don't think I'm ready to lose a real one.","Well, so why not go knock?"
Yeah?,"Phoebs, that's OK. You took a big step today."
"Yeah, and when you do, he'll be lucky to have you.","Yeah, and someday when you're ready, you'll make it past the hedges."
"Oh, that's OK, we'll figure something out.",You guys. I'm sorry about your shopping.
,"Uh, listen Phoebs, I know you're not goin' in there but do you think it'd be alright if I went in and used his bathroom? Oh, that's fine, never mind. Cool, snow, kinda like a blank canvas."
"Really, hey, you mind if I turn the heat down?","Ho, ho, ho, holy crap is it hot in here!"
"Hey, Phoebs, how'd it go.","Hey, we could have used that kind of thinkin' earlier."
"Honey, I'm sorry.","Oh, I couldn't go in."
"Yeah, yeah, no it's OK 'cause, I mean, I know he's there, so, that's enough for now.",Are you OK?
"Hey, Monica, the knob was broken so I just turned it off from underneath, I hope that's alright.","Hey, guys, it's after midnight, merry Christmas everyone."
"Rach, these are for you.",
"No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.",Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.
"Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?","OK, Phoebs, your turn."
You guuuyys.,Uh-huh.
You got me a cola drink?,"And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth."
"Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater.","And, a lemon lime."
They're ribbed for your pleasure.,And last but not least.
"When I was little, I wanted to be a veteranarian, but then I found out you had to put your hands into cows and stuff.",
Are... are you OK?,Hiiiiii.
Maybe.,"Yeah, yeah, just a tough day at work. A stegosaurus fell over and trapped a kid. Whoa, whoa, I know this jacket, this is, th--Fun Bobby's jacket! Where is he, what. He, he's here, isn't he?"
Geller!,Don't toy with me.
"Hey. Whoa, hey, you've been working out, huh?","Hey, Fun Bobby!"
You and me both.,"Not at all! I love this guy. Hey, I was so psyched to hear you're back with my sister!"
"Oh, we were just trying to make Joey feel better.","Hey, so what'd I miss, what'd I miss, c'mon?"
"No, I'm alright man. Really.","Hey, do you need me to pick you up?"
"Hey no, seriously, I don't need you to pick me... Alright! It still works.","No, I'm picking you up."
"OK, I'll see you later babe.","OK, now before I go, does anybody else need to be picked up? I'm still gonna go."
See ya.,"Uh, public display of affection coming up. You can avert your eyes."
Fun Bobby is so great.,Bye! See you later!
Half full of looooovvvvve.,"Oh, isn't he? Oh, you know, I really think this time it may work with him. I mean, he just makes me feel so good and I've been feeling so lousy this last couple of months, no job, no boyfriend. Well, at least my cup is half full."
Cabin of loooooovvvvve.,"And for our two-week anniversary, he's gonna take me to his cousin's cabin for the weekend."
Really? I only had two glasses.,"We went through a lot of wine tonight, you guys."
Two.,I just had a glass.
I had about a mugful in this lovely 'I got boned at the Museum of Natural History' mug.,I had one glass.
Oooooh.,"OK, so that's... that's what, two bottles? And yet somehow we went through five?"
So what. So he drank a lot tonight.,Ooooooh.
"Yeah. Oh, OOOH, yeah, you know, did you notice how he always starts his stories with, um, OK, 'I was soooo wasted,' or, 'Oh, we were soooo bombed,' or, ummm, ooh, ooh, 'So I wake up, and I'm in this dumpster in Connecticut.'","Yeah but, you know, now that I think about it, I don't think I've ever seen Fun Bobby without a... a drink in his hand."
"Well, we just happen to go to alot of places where you might drink. I mean, how do you go to a wine tasting without having a drink? Or... or to a club, or to the... zoo.","Monica, have you ever been with him when he wasn't drinking?"
"Rach, does this have nonfat milk?",
"Mmmm, no.","Ehhhummmm, I don't know, why don't you taste it."
"Whattaya say we make these, uh, coffees Irish?","Oh well, too late, sorry, you already had some."
"Yeah, we're gonna... we're gonna get some cake.","Um, cake."
"Well, I would make them Belgian, but the waffles are hard to get into that flask.",You know what? It seems like you've been making an awful lot of stuff Irish lately.
"Yeah, OK.",Bobby.
"OK, look, this isn't the first time somebody's said something to me about this, but, I don't know... I always made excuses about it, like... uhhh... 'I'm just a social drinker,' or, 'C'mon, it's Flag Day.'","Look, maybe this is none of my business, or maybe it is, I don't know... but, uh, I'm kind of worried about you."
"I guess I'm saying, I'll try and quit. I kinda like that you worry about me.","So, what are you saying now?"
I am gonna try and quit drinking.,"Sooo, what's goin' on, huh?"
Hey.,"Ooohh, why?"
Hey.,Hey.
Guess who's back in show business.,Hey.
"No, no, Phoebs. You know why? Cause he's dead.","Ohh, ohh, Lorne Green?"
"OK, I guess this is gonna seem kinda bittersweet now, but... Joey, that's who.","Oh, no."
"Oh, well, we have to celebrate. You know what we should do? We should do, like, a soap opera theme.","Yeah, my agent just called me with an audition for Days of Our Lives!"
"Hey Rach, what time do you get off? We're all gonna do something tonight.","Hey, yeah... we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia."
You have other friends?,"Ummmm.... well, actually I'm already done, but I...I kinda got plans."
What?,"Yeah... I, uhh... I have a... I have a date."
What? What is so strange about me having a date?,With a man?
"Noooo, no, I'm not mad at him. I'm.. I'm not really anything at him anymore.","What about Ross? I mean, are you still mad at him cause he made that list about you?"
"I don't know. Whatever I was feeling, I'm... not.",What are you talking about?
"Oh, I know, I'm sorry you guys. You're just gonna have to get used to the fact that I will not be dating Ross.",But you guys came so close.
Hhhhiiiii.,"Here he is. Hi. Guys, this is Russ."
"Stop saying you're not talented, you're very talented. It's just with the bird dead and all, there's very little act left. Oh, honey, give me a break, will ya? Oooh, ooh, I'll talk to you later.",
"Well, I think it went pretty well. I.. I got a callback for Thursday.","Well, there's my favorite client. So tell me darling, how was the audition?"
No.,"Joey, have you ever seen me ecstatic?"
"OK, uh.... listen, there's something I want to talk to you about. The network casting lady...","Well, here it is."
"Oh yeah, yeah, she's great, but... I kinda got the feeling that she was sort of... coming on to me. And I definitely would get the part if I would've... you know... if I would have sent the Little General in.","Oh, isn't Lori a doll?"
,"Oh, I see. Well, I'm just gonna put in a call here and we'll find out what's goin' on and straighten it out. Yeah, hi, Lori please. Hi darling. So how 'bout Joey Tribbiani for the part of the cab driver, isn't he terrific? Uh-huuuuh. Uh-huuuuh. OK, doll. Talk to you later. Yeah, you're gonna have to sleep with her."
It's Fun Bobby.,What's the matter?
"Oh, he's sober alright. Just turns out that Fun Bobby was fun for a reason.","What, isn't he sober?"
"Alright, here you go, sweetie.","Ohhh, OK."
"Oh God, yes!",Thanks. You wanna hear something funny?
That is funny.,There are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.
"Ahhh, hey honey? Don't you have to be at your interview now?","I needed to buy a hammer the other night, and I'm out walkin' around the neighborhood but apparently there are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village."
Bye..... ridiculously dull Bobby.,Oh yeah. See you guys.
It's not that bad.,Oh.... my... God.
"OK, OK, don't get all squinky.",Not that bad? Did you hear the hammer story?
"But I'm gonna be there... for the rest of my life. I mean, I can't break up with him. I'm the one who made him quit drinking. He's dull because of me.",Maybe it was just the kind of story where you have to be there.
Hi.,"Alright, don't say that. He's probably always been dull. You just, you know, set it free."
"Hi Russ, I've just got two more tables to clean and then we'll go, OK?",Hey Ross.... bahhhh!
"Rachel? Um, hi.","OK, I'll just sit here and... uh... chat with your, uh.... friend-type....people."
"OK, so, you know what you're doing, right?",Hi.
"Well, yeah, but... no. I mean, umm... doesn't.... doesn't Russ just remind you of someone?",Uhh.... waitressing?
"Oh, yeah! No, no, no, no, oh, oh.","Huh, Bob Saget?"
What? What's wrong?,"Oh, my, oh!"
"She's just upset because she, uh, she buttered a spider into her toast this morning.","I, OK...."
"Listen, Phoebs, this is gonna be OK. Ross, Russ. Russ, Ross.",Alright.
Hi.,Hi.
"Yes, yes I am. Are you a, uh, a friend of Rachel's?","Are you a, uh, friend of Rachel's?"
A date.,"Actually, I'm a... kind of a.... you know, a... date-type... thing... of Rachel's."
"Oh, oh, you're... uh... you're, oh you're the date.","Yeah, I'm her date."
"Oh, you are the, uh... paleontologist.","You know, this is actually good, because if we ever lose Ross, we have a spare."
Periodontist.,"Yes, yes I am. And you are a...."
"Well, I am going to, uh... get a beverage. It was nice, nice... uh... meeting you.",See? They're as different as night and... later that night.
"I, uh, well... I... I met Russ.",Ditto.
"Hey, I didn't know we were, uh, seeing other people.",Oh.
"Well, uh, for your information, there's a woman at the museum, who's curator of moths and other... uh... winged things... who's, uh, let it be known that she is drawn to me much like a... well, you know. But so far I've been keeping her at bay, but, uh, if this is the deal...","Well, we're not seeing each other, so...."
"OK, well, um, have a nice evening.","Well, yeah, this is the deal."
Yeah.,"Um, Russ, you ready?"
Bye.,Bye.
She's dating. She's dating.,Bye.
What do you mean?,"Yes, yes, but did you see who she was dating?"
"See what? I don't know what she sees in... innn that goober. And it takes him, what? Like... like... I don't know, uhh... uhhh, hello.... a... week, to get out a sentence.",Do you not see it?
....................Yeah.,"Yeah, it's annoying, isn't it?"
Hey.,
"Whoa, whoa, so I'm guessing you didn't get the part, or... uh, Italy called and said it was hungry.",Hey.
Oh my God!,"Well, the part's mine if I want it."
Oh my... God?,"Yeah, if I'm willing to sleep with the casting lady."
"So, what're you gonna do?","Ten years I've been waiting for a break like this Chandler, ten years! I mean, Days of Our Lives. That's actually on television."
"Well, I... I've got a pop-up book that told me everything I need to know.","Well, I guess I could sleep with her... I mean, how could I do that?"
Well is she...,I've never slept with someone for a part.
It's alright. Is she good-looking?,Sorry.
"Y'know, maybe this isn't such a big deal. Y'know, I mean, the way that I see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex. Y'know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got Christmas.","Yeah, she's totally good looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I'd be buying her breakfast. You know, after having slept with her."
Didn't you used to call it the Little Major?,"I just... I just don't think that I want it that way though, y'know? I mean, let's say I do make it, alright? I'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y'know, the Little General."
,"Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it."
"Yes, I would like something. No, no thank you.",Can I get you something from the bar?
"No, no really. I.. I wouldn't feel right about it. Just some water.","If... if you want to drink, it's OK with me, I've got to get used to it."
I'd like a scotch on the rocks with a twist.,So the light went out in my refrigerator...
"Hey, we're having some fun now, huh, Ross? Wanna do another one, huh Russ? OK... eleven letters, atomic element number 101... ends in ium.",
Dysprosium? Try mendelevium.,Dysprosium.
You don't see it? You actually don't see it?,"And weenie number two has it. Unless, of course, nine-down, Knights in White Satin was sung by the Doody Blues."
"OK honey, you're dating Ross.",What?
Russ is Ross. Russ... Ross!,"No, Phoebs. I'm dating Russ."
"OK, noone is named Sleeve.",Steve... sleeve!
"For your information, it's a card sharp, not a card shark.","Phoebe, what the hell are you talking about? Other than their names being similar, I'm sorry, I do not see what you're seeing."
"OK, I'm gonna get some more coffee before the pinching and eye-poking begins.",You could not be more wrong. You could try... but you would not be successful.
"Oh you do, do you?",I know what your problem is.
Of... of what?,"Um-hum, you're jealous."
"Hey, you're a doctor of gums. That's the smallest body part you can major in. It's like day one, floss. Day two, here's your diploma.",You're jealous because I'm a real doctor.
"No, no, let me finish.","Hey, you listen."
"No, you let me fini...","No, let me finish."
Hi.,Hi.
,"Ewww, ewww, ewww, ewww!"
"No, I don't even think he knew. Hey, would you sleep with somebody to get a great job?",Did Joey say what he was gonna go when he left?
Me.,I don't know. Who would I have to sleep with?
It's my game. You want the job or not?,Why would I have to sleep with you?
Morning.,Hey.
"Bobby and I are going away for the weekend, remember?",Where ya goin'?
What's with all the bottles of liquor?,Ooooohhhh.
"Oh no no, this is not for him, this is for me. That way he's still sober but I find his stories about shoelaces much more amusing.","What's going on, is... uh, Bobby drinking again?"
Hi. I'll be ready in just a second.,"Oh God, even his knock is boring."
Sure.,"Uh, can I talk to you a minute?"
"Oh God, you fell off the wagon.",This is really hard for me to say.
What about me?,"Oh, no, no, it's about you."
"What these? Oh, these are, um, for.. cuts and scrapes.",I think you may have a drinking problem.
Oh... shoot.,"Look, I am just not strong enough to be in a codependent relationship right now, OK?"
OK.,"Well, anyway, I hope we can be friends."
You too.,Take care.
Well we... we kinda broke up.,What happened?
Does anybody want these?,Awwwwwwww.
Hey.,I'll take one. Sometimes I like to hold stuff like this and pretend I'm a giant.
How'd the callback go?,Hey!
So what'd you do?,It was unbelievable! I walked in there and she was all over me.
Good for you.,"Well, I couldn't do it. I told her I didn't want to get the part that way."
So... and?,"But wait, wait, wait. Then, after I left her office, she caught up with me at the elevator and offered me an even bigger part."
Allright!,"Soooooo... you are now looking at Dr. Drake Ramore, neurosurgeon, recurring in at least four episodes!"
,Alright... I've got to go shower.
"Oh, hey.",Hi.
"I guess you guys heard, Rachel dumped me.",Hi.
"Oh, all she said was that I remind her too much of somebody. You have any idea who she's talking about?","Yeah, I'm sorry man."
Oh.,"Oh I do, it's.... it's Bob Saget. She hates him."
Hey!,Hey.
"Um, oh, I don't know. I mean, it's definitely weird not being with Ross, but I guess I'm doing OK. Actually I've got some of his stuff that he, um....","Hey, Julie! Hey, how are you doing?"
"Ok. Here's his diaper bag, and his uh, Mr. Winky, and uh...oh, him. Hi!",
"Oh, great. Great. There was a projectile, uh, throwing up incident, but he started it.",So how did everything go?
Ok.,"Well, we've gotta go."
"Oh, right. Um, I've got some news. It's about us.",
"Uh, no, Susan and me.","Oh, you and me?"
Ok.,The other us.
"As in, ""I now pronounce you wife and wife"" married?","We're uh, we're getting married."
Why wouldn't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding.,"Anyway, we'd like you to come, but we totally understand if you don't want to."
"No no no, I mean, hey, why shouldn't I be happy for you? What would it say about me if I couldn't revel in your joy? I'm revelling baby, believe me!",Look I just thought that...
Mmm hmmm.,Is your finger caught in that chair?
Uh-huh.,Want us to go?
This is so cool. You're actually gonna be on television.,
"Yes! Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's in a full body cast.","It really hit me last night. I'm gonna be on Days of our Lives. And then I started thinkin' about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives.."
"They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered before, and I really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it?",Yes!
"Oh, you are so great! Thank you!",Would it matter?
"I am really not going. I don't get it. They already live together, why do they need to get married?",Are you really not going?
If you wanna call that a reason.,"They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them."
"Ross, I thought you were over this.","Who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor."
"Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever.","Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there."
"No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself.",Did I miss it? Did I miss it?
"Yeah, and she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.","Whoa, she's pretty."
What?,"I'm sorry, what?"
"Oh, ok.","It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this."
Is she gonna be all right?,"There's my scene, there's my scene. ""Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon."
Nice!,I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..subcranial hematoma. Perhaps we can discuss this over coffee.
Excellent!,That's great!
,For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin' to smell something.
"All right, all right. ""Damnit Braverman, it's right there on the chart!""",That is so good! Do it again!
"No no, that's me.","That's great. All right, I gotta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect."
"Oh, hello.","Oh, yeah."
Is everything ok?,"Oh, thanks. I couldn't uh..."
Oh my god.,"Um, no, huh-uh. One of my clients died on the massage table today."
"Yeah, um, she was 82 years old. Her name was um, Mrs. Adelman.",That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.
"Yeah, it's just so strange. I mean, she probably woke up today and thought, ""ok, I'll have some breakfast, and then I'll take a little walk, and then I'll have my massage."" Little did she know God was thinking, ""Ok, but that's it."" Oh, but the weirdest thing was, ok, I was cleansing her aura when she died, and when the spirit left her body, I don't think it went very far.","Oh, honey."
I think it went into me.,What do you mean?
"God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.",
"Ok, who ordered what?","Well, of course, lambs are scarier. Otherwise the movie would've been called Silence of the Ducks."
"Yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?","Oh, I believe I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim."
I can't believe you're so uptight about your mom comin'.,Oh god.
Talk about crap. Try listening to Stella Niedman tell the story of her and Rod Steiger for the hundredth time.,"I know, but it's just it's the first time, and I just don't want her to think that because I didn't marry Barry, that my life is total crap, you know?"
"I don't know. I mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business. Sit up!","Uh, Pheebs, how long do you think this lady'll be with us?"
Mom!,There she is.
Pretty much.,"Sweetie! So this is where you work? Oh, it's wonderful! Is it a living room? Is it a restaurant? Who can tell? But I guess that's the fun."
"This is Joey, and Phoebe, and this is Chandler, and you remember Ross.","Monica! You look gorgeous! Last time I saw you, it was eat or be eaten."
"Hi, Mrs. Green.","Oh hello, Ross."
Oh Mom!,"So, what do you think of my daughter in the apron with the big job?"
"Believe me, sometimes that happens.","If you didn't pour the coffee, no one would have anything to drink."
Really?,"This is just so exciting. You know, I never worked. I went straight from my father's house to the sorority house to my husband's house. I am just so proud of you."
"I know who it is you remind me of. Evelyn Dermer. 'Course, that's before she got the lousy face lift. Now she looks like Soupy Sales.",Yes.
I don't know. Who's Soupy Sales?,"Pheebs, who's Evelyn Dermer?"
"Oh my god, there's an unattractive nude man playing the cello.",
"You have some life here, sweetie.","Yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument."
"I do. You didn't love Barry. And I've never seen you this happy. I look at you and I think, oh, this is what I want.","I know. And Mom, I realize you and Daddy were upset when I didn't marry Barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but this is just so much better for me, you know?"
"Well, not just for you.",For...me.
"I'm uh, considering leaving your father.","Well, what do you mean?"
Oh god. I think I'm gonna be sick.,"All right. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts."
And you had no idea they weren't getting along?,Why? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them.
They didn't fight a lot?,None.
"In my day, divorce was not an option.","No! They didn't even talk to each other. God, how was I supposed to know they were having problems?"
"I just can't believe this is happening. I mean, when I was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced. I just figured as a grownup I wouldn't have to worry about this.","Hey, look who's up."
"Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?","Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you."
That's him.,"You know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your case it's actually kinda true."
Phoebe?,Damn. My mail order grandfather hasn't come yet.
"Oh, that's all right, although you did cut into my busy day of sitting.","Yes, hi, Mr. Adelman. Thanks for meeting me."
"Oh, no, please, I spent most of mid-morning trying to stand up. Now uh, what can I do for you, my dear?","Um, do you wanna sit?"
"You're saying, my wife is in you?","I don't know how to say this, but I think when your wife's spirit left her body, it um, kind of stuck around in me."
"Well, I don't know what to tell you dear. The only thing I can think of is that she always used to say that before she died, she wanted to see everything.","Yeah. Ok, you don't have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished business she might have had, like any reason she'd be hanging around?"
Everything.,Everything?
"Oh, wait, I remember, she also said she wanted to sleep with me one last time.","Whoa, that's a lot of stuff."
"Worth a shot, huh?","I'm sorry, there's laughing in my head."
Look at this.,
"Oh, look, here's Barry. Did he have to come straight from the office?",These are from Halloween three years ago.
"Um, you guys, you know when I said before, ""thank you, but I don't really need your help""?","No, that was his costume. See, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist."
"Really? Weird. Anyway, see, I planned everything really well. I planned and I planned and I planned. It just turns out, I don't think I planned enough time to actually do it.","Actually, what I think you said was, ""don't touch that, and get the hell out of my kitchen."""
If you want.,"Hey, Mon, you want some help?"
She's still with you?,"Hey. What a day. I took her everywhere. The Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty."
"This is so much fun, just the girls. You know what we should do? Does anybody have any marijuana?","Yeah. I guess she hasn't seen everything yet. I'll be right back, she has to go to the bathroom again. Oh, such a pretty face."
"All right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food.",God!
Oh! What's new in sex?,"That's fine. I never did it. I just thought I might. So, what's new in sex?"
"I'm dicing, I'm dicing, I don't hear anything.",The only man I've ever been with is your father.
"Oh, I'm sorry. You know what? I cannot have this conversation with you. I mean, god, you just come in here, and drop this bomb on me, before you even tell Daddy. What? What do you want? Do you want my blessing?","I mean, this is no offense to your dad, sweetie, but I was thinking there might be more."
You want me to talk you out of it?,No.
Then what? What do you want?,No.
Why on earth would I understand this?,I guess I just figured of all people you would understand this.
Oh.,You didn't marry your Barry. I did.
"Monica, I feel like you should have German subtitles.","All right people, we're in trouble here. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. Move, move, move!"
"I'm sorry, it's the pigs. they're reluctant to get in the blankets!","Joey, speed it up!"
Do you want me to cry? Is that what you want? Do you wanna see me cry?,"Monica, how did this happen? I thought you had this all planned out."
"All right, you!",Sir! No sir!
"All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do. But if you don't help me cook, I'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I'm gonna create a new appetizer called ""pigs in Ross"". All right, ball the melon.","No. Look, I told you I am not a part of this thing."
,"Hey! How come I'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon."
How's it going?,Hi.
"Fine, whatever.",It's goin' great. Right on schedule. Got my little happy helpers.
"Nothing. Ok, everything. I think we're calling off the wedding.",What's the matter?
"You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.",What?
My parents called this afternoon to say they weren't coming.,"Carol, what's the matter? What happened?"
"I mean, I knew they were having trouble with this whole thing, but they're my parents. They're supposed to give me away and everything.",Oh my god.
"And then Susan and I got in this big fight because I said maybe we should call off the wedding, and she said we weren't doing it for them, we were doing it for us, and if I couldn't see that, then maybe we should call off the wedding. I don't know what to do.",It's ok. I'm sorry.
You do?,"I uh can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right."
Of course I do.,"Look, do you love her? And you don't have to be too emphatic about this."
You're right. Of course you're right.,"Well then that's it. And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them. Look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. Look, this is your wedding. Do it."
We're back on.,So we're back on?
,"You heard the woman. Peel, chop, devil! I can't believe I lost 2 minutes."
"Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my lesbian wedding.","It just seems so futile, you know ? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly."
Thank you.,"Butterscotch? No one? All right, you'll be sorry later."
Ross.,Any time.
"Oh my god. Now I've seen everything! Whoa, she's gone. She's gone. She's gone! Go ahead, get married. Go, go.","You know, nothing makes God happier than when two people, any two people, come together in love. Friends, family, we're gathered here today to join Carol and Susan in holy matrimony."
Would you look at them?,
How's that pig-in-the-blanket workin' out for you? I wrapped those bad boys.,"Yeah, can't help but."
"Oh, yeah?",I miss Rose.
"You know, I uh, I couldn't help but overhear what you just said, and I think it's time for you to forget about Rose, move on with your life...how 'bout we go get you a drink?","I know it's kind of weird, but I mean, she was a big part of my life there, you know, and now I just feel kind of alone."
"I shouldn't even bother coming up with a line, right?","Ok, that's so nice."
"Oh, am I! I just danced with a wonderfully large woman. And three other girls made eyes at me over the buffet. Oh, I'm not saying it's something I wanna pursue, but it's nice to know I have options.","Hey, Mom? Having fun?"
,"There's more alcohol, right?"
Ok.,How you doin'?
Yeah.,You did a good thing today.
"No, that's fine.",You wanna dance?
Ok.,Come on. I'll let you lead.
,All right look. Penis schmenis. We're all people.
"Well, Mon, I was married.","Ok, which one of us do you think is gonna be the first one to get married?"
I had a wedding.,"Yeah, me, too, technically."
I got one. Which one of us do you think will be the last to get married?,"All right, just trying to start an interesting discussion."
"Oh, yeah!",Isn't Ben in this?
,
"Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything seems to work out OK.",That commercial always makes me so sad.
"I can see that, 'cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the little pouty chin.",I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel.
"Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, ya know, giving him away.",And the fact that they're both monkeys.
"Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it.","Oh, Ross, you had to, I mean, he was humping everything in sight. I mean, I have a Malibu Barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding."
,"Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss's hat. . . all of the sudden I have this big attitude problem."
"Hey, hey, check it out, guess what I got.",
"No, my first fan mail.",Rhythm?
"'Dear Dr. Remore, know that I love you and would do anything to have you.' Gosh. 'Your not-so-secretive admirer, Erica Ford.' Ooh wait, 'PS enclosed please find 14 of my eyelashes.'",Alright!
"This wasn't addressed to Days of Our Lives, this is, this came to your apartment. There's no stamp on it, this woman was in our building.","Ya know, in crazy world, that means you're married."
Hey guys.,"Oh my god, I got my very own stalker."
"Ooh, where are you off to, Travelin' Jake?",Hey.
"You know I think he will be surprised, 'till he realizes he's a monkey, and uh, you know, isn't capable of that emotion.","Well, there's this, uh, paleontology conference in L.A. so I figured I'd go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel."
"Oh, oh, OK, so everyone, pretend like I'm telling you a story, OK. And, and it's really funny. So everyone just laugh, now.","Oh, Phoebe, that really cute guy is here again."
Hi. I'm Rob Dohnen.,"I know, I know. Hello."
"I don't know anything about music, but I think you're really, really great.",Hi Rob Dohnen.
"Anyway, I schedule performers for the childrens libraries around the city and I was just thinking, have you ever thought about playing your songs for kids?","Oh, wow."
,"Oh, I would love to have kids. . . you're, you're the, you're, me play the songs that I will write for them."
Well we could just stay in and cook for ourselves.,"Hey, whaddya wanna do for dinner?"
It's Erica.,Hello.
"Never mind, it's open.","Ah, the stalker."
Let's get out of here.,"Yes, hitting her with a frying pan's a good idea. We might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon."
"OK, we'll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me 'cause we've never met.",The one time they're not home.
She's comin'.,That's how radio stars escape stalkers.
"Uhh, this is it, this is how we're gonna die. Ready?",It's me.
Hi.,"Wait, wait, wait."
,Erica.
"Well, I uh, I can't seem to find the monkey I donated last year. He's a capuchan, answers to the name Marcel.","Hi, Dean Lipson, zoo administrator. I was told you had a question."
"Oh my God, what happened?","Ahh, I'm afraid I have some bad news. Marcel has passed on."
I can't believe this.,"Well he got sick, and then he got sicker, and then he got a little better but then he died."
"Well, ya know, someone should have called me.","I'm sorry Mr. Geller. But ya know, there's an old saying, 'Sometimes monkeys die.' It's not a great saying but it certainly is fitting today."
Zoo dollars?,"I'm sorry. Look, I know this can't bring him back but here, it's just a gesture."
,"Yes, and come see the bird show at 4. The macaws wear hats. Well it's a lot cuter if your monkey hasn't just died."
Ooohhh.,
"I can't believe Joey's having lunch with his stalker. What i-, what is she like.",I know.
Yeah.,"Well, you remember Cathy Bates in Misery?"
And she's not crazy?,"Well, she looks the exact opposite of that."
Oh my God.,"Oh no no no, she's a total wack job. Yeah, she thinks that Joey is actually Dr. Drake Remore."
"Hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see Joey through the magical box in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person. I mean, does she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love? What're you lookin' at me for? He's the one who wants to boff the maniac.","Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her? He can not persue this."
"No, uh-uh, I'm just, I'm nervous. So, you know what, maybe if I just, if I picture them all in their underwear.",You OK?
"I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm used to playing for grown-ups. Ya know, they just, grown-ups drink their coffee and do their grown-up thing, ya know, and kids listen. This is a huge responsibility. What? Are you gonna kiss me?","That's not a good idea, that's kinda the reason the last guy got fired."
"OK. OK, alrighty, let's play some tunes. Hi everybody, I'm Phoebe",I was thinkin' about it.
"OK, um, I'm gonna play, um, some songs about grandparents, OK. Now, grandma's a person who everyone likes, she bought you a train and a bright, shiny bike. But lately she hasn't been coming to dinner, And last time you saw her she looked so much thinner. Now, your mom and your dad said she moved to Peru, but the truth is she died and some day you will too. La-la-la la la-la-la la la-la-la la...",Hi Phoebe.
"Oh, Drake, isn't it amazing?",
"Well, here we sit, devil may care, just a little while ago you were reattaching someone's spinal cord.",Yeah it is. . . what?
Who's they?,"Yeah, that was a tricky one. In reality, that operation takes like, over 10 hours, but they only showed it for 2 minites."
"Oh Drake, you are so talented, let me see those hands. Oh these hands, these beautiful hands, oh I could just eat them. . . but I won't.",No one.
"No, seriously. These hands. These miracle, magical, life-giving hands. Oh, just to be near them, touch them, maybe even lick one?","Good, otherwise my watch would fall off."
"Oh my God! Someone, he's choking. Is anyone here a doctor?","Alright, just one. Wow, you're good at that."
,"Well, yes, yes, the best doctor in all of Salem, Dr. Drake Remore."
"Uhh, hey look, I don't really enjoy being with other men that way. But, um, zoo dollars?",Meet me in the nocturnal house in 15 minutes.
,It's about your monkey. It's alive.
"Uhh, cause, uhh, I'm a neurosurgeon and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh, foodal chokage. Alright, look, I got to tell you something.","I don't understand, why didn't you help that man?"
But that's what...,"No, no no no, you don't have to tell me anything. You don't have to explain yourself to me. Ooh, who am I to question the great Dr. Drake Remore?"
Hey I-,I should just be happy to be near you.
"That's it, just hey. Like at the end of a dance, HEY! Hey. He-hey.",Hey what?
"There'll be times when you get older when you'll want to sleep with people just to make them like you. . . But don't. Cause that's another thing that you don't wanna do, everybody That's another thing that you don't wanna do.",
Very informative!,Excellent!
Thank you for coming everybody. There're cookies in the back.,Not at all inappropriate!
"Yay, I rock.","That was great, the kids loved you."
But.,"And you know why? Because you told the truth, and nobody ever tells kids the truth.You were incredible."
I sense these things. It was either but or butter.,How did you know there was a but?
I can do that.,"The thing is, I think some of the parents, they were kinda hopin' that you'd play more songs about like, barnyard animals."
Yeah.,Really?
Thinkin' about it.,Because that would be fantastic. What? You wanna kiss me?
"Ahh, the bat. Ambassador of darkness, flitting out of his cave like a winged messenger, sightless spectre of the macabe.",
"Oh, yeah, right. There was a break-in, few months back, inside job. Your monkey was taken.","Buddy, my monkey?"
The zoo! Do you believe everything the zoo tells ya?,Oh my God. But the zoo told me that my monkey was dead.
Of course they're gonna say he's dead. They don't want the bad publicity. It's all a great big cover-up. Do you have any idea how high up this thing goes?,"That, that's the only thing the zoo's ever told me."
Lipson knows. Do you have any idea who else knows?,That guy Lipson?
"Hmm, Lipson knows huh? Ahh, hello Mr. Opossum, enigma of the trees, upside-down denizen of the night, taunting gravity with...","No, I, I only know Lipson."
"Word on the street - well, when I say street, I mean those little pretend streets they have here at the zoo.","Buddy, my monkey, my monkey."
"Your monkey found a new career, in the entertainment field. That's all I know.",Of course.
"So, what is this information worth to you, my friend?",This is unbelievable.
Maybe.,Are you trying to get me to bribe you?
,But you already told me everything.
"Well, so what're you gonna do?","Check it out, he actually is the MonkeyShine monkey."
That's what I did when I lost my Clydesdales.,"Well, I guess I'm gonna call the beer company and try to find out where he is."
Hi Phoebe.,"OK, hi again."
,"Today we're gonna start with some songs about barnyard animals. Oh, the cow in the meadow goes moo, Oh, the cow in the meadow goes moo. Then the farmer hits him on the head and grinds him up, And that's how we get hamburgers. Nooowww, chickens!"
"Damnit, I'm a doctor, I'm not God.",You're the only one who can save her Drake.
It's Erica.,"Well, there goes my whole belief system."
"No no no, wait, I wanna see what happens.","Oh my God, quick turn off the TV."
"Well how can that be, you were just kissing Sabrina?","Uh, I get Leslie out of the coma and then we make out."
"Hey Erica, c'mon in.","Rachel, it's a world where Joey is a neuro-surgeon."
"Right, they uh, they choppered me in. What's up?","How did you get here so fast, I just saw you in Salem?"
Who?,"Ohh, and I see you're having a little party too. Is she here, huh, huh?"
"It's not what you think, that was...",Sabrina. I know about you two. I saw you today kissing in the doctor's lounge.
"Alright look, that's it. I don't think we should see each other anymore, alright. Look, I know I should have told you this a long time ago but I am not Drake Remore, OK. I'm not even a doctor, I'm an actor. I just pretend to be a doctor.",You told me I was the only one.
Somebody wanna help me out here?,Oh my God. Do the people at the hospital know about this?
"How, how can you be here and there.","Oh, I know, I know."
"Drake, what're you getting at?",'Cause it's a television show.
"That's right, he's not Drake, he's Hans Remore, Drake's evil twin.",I'm not Drake.
"Yes, yes it is true. And I know this because, because he pretended to be Drake to, to sleep with me.",Is this true?
"And you left the toilet seat up, you bastard.","And then he told me he would run away with me, and he didn't."
"Yes, I'm afraid it is. You deserve much better than me Erica. You deserve to be with the real Drake, he's the one you fell in love with. Go to Salem, find him, he's the guy for you.",Is all this true?
Hans...Hans...Yo evil twin.,Oh Hans.
I'll never forget you Hans.,"Right. Goodbye Erica, good luck in Salem. Take care"
,"OK, alright, the people who threw the water."
The library board has had a lot of complaints from parents about some of the stuff in your songs.,Fired! Why?
No.,I can't believe it. Did you tell your board about how kids want to hear the truth?
Maybe if you just played some regular kiddie songs.,I see.
I'm not saying you have to be Barney.,"No. What do you, what do you want me to be, like some stupid, big, like, purple dinosaur?"
,Who's Barney.
You're kidding.,"Well, I tracked down Marcel and get this, he's healthy, he's happy, and he's right here in New York filming Outbreak II - The Virus Takes Manhattan."
I know.,This is amazing.
"OK, Rachel, I'm ready.",I finally get a part on TV and the monkey's makin' movies.
Excuse me. Is this where the singing lady is that tells the truth?,OK.
She's here.,"Um, yeah I guess that's me."
,"Sometimes men love women, sometimes men love men, and then there are bisexuals, though some just say they're kidding themselves. la la-la-la la-la-la-la-la-la-la..."
"What, you never look down in the shower? Oh please. I'm not allowed to make one joke in the monkey-is-penis genre?","This is so exciting, I haven't seen my monkey in almost a year."
"Uh, excuse me, uh, where can we find the monkey?","C'mon people, back up please, back up, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon."
"Uh, I'm sorry, you don't understand, I'm, I'm, I'm a friend of his. We uh, we used to live together.","I'm sorry guys, closed set."
"Ross, there he is.","Yeah, and I have a time share in the Pocanos with Flipper."
,"Hey, hey buddy, Marcel. Marcel. In the jungle, the mighty jungle the lion sleeps tonight. In the jungle, the mighty jungle the lion sleeps tonight. a-weema-way, a-weema-way....."
Closed set. We know but we're friends with the monkey.,"Uh, excuse me folks this is a uhh..."
"Woah, dude, burn.","Good morning. Hey pal, look who I brought. It's your old friend Harry Elefante."
"Hey don't take it personal, he's under a lot of pressure, ya know, starring in a movie and all.","I don't get it, he seemed so happy to see me yesterday."
"In human terms, I'd say Cybill Shepard.",Now just how big of a star is Marcel?
"So, are you guys in the movie, or are you just really paranoid.",Woah.
"Uh, excuse me. Jerry is the director, which one's he?","Hey Sal, Jerry wants to know if the monkey's ready for the subway set?"
"Gotcha. Phoebs, walk with me.",The one in the director's chair.
"Well, we're, we're just goin' over here so that we can get away from the horrible flesh eating virus, for the love of God woman, listen to me. Is he lookin', is he lookin'?","OK. Um, how come I'm walking with you?"
Tell me.,We've got a problem.
Is it bad?,I can't do Chris's makeup. She refuses to acknowledge that she has a moustasche.
I'll talk to her.,"It looks like one of her eyebrows fell down. Now unless someone convinces her to let me bleach it, Jean-Claude Van Damme is gonna be making out with Gabe Kaplan."
"Nice camoflauge man, for a minute there I almost didn't see ya.",I hate actors.
Ahhhh.,Excuse me.
"Uh, yes, yes it is.","Uh, is your name Chandler?"
Do you know me or are you just really good at this game?,Chandler Bing?
"Susie Moss, right, yeah, wow, you look. . . great job growing up.","I'm Susie Moss. Fourth grade, glasses, I used to carry around a box of animal crackers like a purse."
"Oh, right, well yeah, I graduated fourth grade and realized I wasn't a pimp.",It's nice to see you're not still wearing that denim cap with all the little mirrors on it.
"Yes, back then I, uh, used humor as a defense mechanism. Thank God I don't do that anymore.","Remember the class play? You, you pulled up my skirt and the entire auditorium saw my underpants."
What what what what?,"Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God."
Ya think?,"Jean-Claude Van Damme. I didn't know he was in this movie, he is so hot."
"No, was he any good in it?","The muscles from Brussels, wham bam Van Damme, did you see Time Cop?"
"Wow, so why don't you go talk to him?","Rachel, he like, totally changed time."
"What, so you go over there, you tell him you think he's cute, what's the worst that could happen?","Oh, yeah."
"OK, I'm doin' it for ya.",He could hear me.
Excuse me. Hi.,"Oh Rachel don't, don't you dare, don't, don't. Tell him I cook."
"Um, this is gonna sound kinda goofy but uhhm, my friend over there, who cooks by the way, um, she thinks you're cute.",Hi.
"I, I don't know, um, do you think you're cute? OK, we're kinda gettin' off the track here. Um, I was supposed to come here and tell you my friend thinks you're cute. So what should I tell her?",You don't think I'm cute?
"No, Stephen Hurs was the kid who would eat anything for money, David Stein was the guy who had no elbows.",You can tell her I think her friend is cute.
"OK that's not what he was doing. Alright, he was looking for his bus money.","OK, well then who was the kid that got caught masturbating?"
"Oh uh, o, OK.","Oh that's me, I gotta go."
"Well, uh, let's try one more. . . there you go, say Ernie's, 8 o'clock.","Um, so listen, how many times am I gonna have to touch you on the arm before you ask me on a date."
No one was around to hear that?,"I'll be there, and who knows, if things go well, maybe this time I'll get to see your underwear."
"Agh, what a jerk. I kept talking about you and he kept asking me out. I mean, naturally, you know, I said no.",So what'd he say?
"He just kept asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking.","Well, thanks anyway."
"Jean-Claude she said yes, I'll see you tonight. Thank you.","Rachel if you, if you want to go out with him, you can. Sound like a big jerk to me but if that's what you want to do..."
And then Jean-Claude took me to that place Crossroads and that's where we hung out with Drew Barrymore.,
Does anybody need anything?,"Oh man, she's so smokin, she has got the greatest set of. . . no guys around, huh."
That is so unfair.,"Oh, I'll have an espresso. Oh acutally, I'll get it. If I ask you to, you'll probably end up drinking it yourself."
"Hey Joey I have to cancel racketball for tonight, that was Marcel's trainer. He's gonna let me have him for a couple of hours.","I know. Oh, like you would drink her coffee after what you did to her with Van Damme."
"Hey, we can rescedule for Saturday.",You're blowin' me off for a monkey?
"Hey, stick a fork in me, I am done.","Yeah, unless you hook up with a bunch of pigeons."
"Like, when you're cooking a steak.",Stick a fork what?

"If you hated the bracelet so much, Chandler, you should have just said so.","Hey man, look it's my best bud. How ya doin? Wow, you are really gettin' good at that Marcel Marceau thing. Hey, whaddya say uh, we play some ball, you and me, huh, whaddya say? OK, that's my bad."
"Well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me?","Well, doesn't the fact that I wore the bracelet even though I hated it say something about our friendship and how much it means to me?"
You know what the. . .,"OK, well that's the part where I'm a wank. But I was hoping we wouldn't focus on that. Hey, c'mon man, I said I was sorry like a hundred times, I promise I will never take it off my. . . wrist. But if, if you want to stay in there and be mad, you know, you just uh, you stay in there."

You were fired? What're you gonna do?,Because they made me.
In the bank.,"Judy, Judy, relax, this is our little harmonica we're talking about. We taught her well. Ten percent of your paycheck, where does it go?"
Anything larger back there?,"There you go. So she dips into her savings, that's what it's there for. She's gonna be fine, and if you need a little extra, you know where to find it."
I can't believe it.,
"Oh, you're right I, I should play in the hay. Forget about the fact that I just dropped 400 dollars to replace a bracelet that I hated to begin with. Bring on the hay.",Would you stop already? Get out of the bitter barn and play in the hay.

,That's what they'll call us.
You have dinosaur checks?,"Here you go, you can pay me back whenever you like."
"Nothin', nothin', hey you're a cheapasaurus. I'm kidding, I'm kidding, thank you, I'm very greatful.","Yeah, yeah I mean, you get your money and you learn a little something, what's wrong with that?"

"Oh my God, look there's Roy Gublik.",Work on your music?
"Where's Chip, why isn't he here yet?","Ya know, Roy saw Star Wars 317 times. His name was in the paper."
I just told Rachel that Roy touched my boob.,"He'll be here OK, take a chill pill."
If you're not going then I don't want to go either.,"I can't go to my own prom without a date, I can't, it's too late."
I have a wonderful idea. You should take Rachel to the prom.,"Oh, I'm gonna kick Chip's ass."
"Jack, give me that. Talk to your son.",Doubtful.
"Dad, she won't want to go with me.","Your mother's right. Take her, you can wear my tux."
I don't know.,"Of course she would, you're a college man."
"I can't believe I don't get to go to my own prom, this is so harsh.","Well, c'mon. Don't ya want to find out?"

I'm sorry.,"Yeah, since the divorce, when anybody asks me how I am, it's always with a sympathetic head tilt. 'How ya doin'? You OK?'"
"Oh, that's too bad.","No no, it, it's fine, believe me. I do it too. I always answer with the 'I'm OK' head bob. 'I'm OK.' 'You sure?' 'Yeah, I'm fine.' Hey listen, I've got to set up the music. I got a new CD changer, of course the divorce only left me with 4 CD's to change."

You're not the only one who has a date tonight.,"Well, why're you all dressed up?"
No one.,What? You have a date? Who with?
Nothing.,"C'mon, what's his name?"
"Alright, but I'm very excited about this OK, so you gotta promise you won't get all big-brothery and judgmental.","Come on, tell me."

Well maybe he was nervous.,"Woah, woah, woah australopithicus isn't supposed to be in that display. No. No. No, n, homo-habilus was erect, australopithicus was never fully erect."
"Oh look, I can't believe this. Look, homo-habilus hasn't even learned how to use tools yet and they've got him here wi, with clay pots. Why don't, why don't they just give him a microwave? I'm sorry, I'm sorry this is taking so long, ya know, I, I, it's just it's longer than I expected, we will have dinner.",

"Oh, you're a grandpa.","No no. Henry's almost two and he's talking and everyting. Here. You know, the other day he told me he liked me better than his other grandpa. Now in all fairness his other grandpa's a drunk but still. . ."

We won't?,"No, no, we won't."

This time it's not so funny.,You're not laughing.
"What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.","Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK."
,"Oh, thank God."
Hi you. I can't believe I'm waking up next to you.,Hi.
What?,I know it is pretty unbelievaaaaah.
,We're not alone.
Is that the fire alarm?,
Cool.,"Yeah. Oh it's not warm yet, we still have time."
Man this is weird. You ever realize Captain Crunch's eyebrows are actually on his hat?,
Waaa-aaah.,"That's what's weird? Joey, the man's been captain of a cereal for the last 40 years."
The spoon. You licked and-and you put. You licked and you put.,What?
Well don't you see how gross that is? I mean that's like you using my toothbrush. You used my toothbrush?,"Yeah, so."
"Mine is the red one! Oh God. Can open, worms everywhere.","Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain."
Because soap is soap. It's self-cleaning.,"Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?"
,"Alright, well next time you take a shower, think about the last thing I wash and the first thing you wash."
Hey.,Hey.
"Ooh, look at you fancy lads. What's the occasion?",Hey.
Ahh.,"Well, you know that guy that's on my show that's in a coma? He's havin' a brunch."
Okey-doke.,"OK, ready when you are."
"Excuse me, you guys are getting tattoos?",I can't believe you guys are actually getting tattoos.
"Wow, this is wild. What're you gonna get?","Yes, but you can not tell Ross 'cause I want to surprise him."
"Wow, that's lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch?","Um, I'm getting a lily for my Mom. 'Cause her name's Lily."
I think on my shoulder.,So where you gettin' it?
"Um, a chip. A tattoo, I'm getting a tattoo.",What? What's on your shoulder?
"Hi. Well hey, you don't - you don't think they're kind of cool?","A tattoo? Why, why would you want to do that? Hi."
"Ross, come sign this birthday card for dad. Rich is gonna be here any minute.","No, sorry I don't. Tell me why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life? What if it doesn't come out right Phoebe? Then it's like, I don't know, havin' a bad hair cut all the time. Why's everyone staring at me?"
"Well, he's my parents' best friend, he has to be there.","Oooh, Rich is goin' to the party too, huh?"
"Yeah. It's my dad's birthday, I decided to give him a stroke.","Oh, is today the day you're gonna tell them about you two?"
"No, I don't even know how serious he is about me. Until I do, I'm not telling them anything.","No, I think you should tell them."
,"I don't know, I don't think mom and dad would mind. Remember when you were 9 and Richard was 30, how dad used to say, 'God I hope they get together.'"
"OK, wait, wait, wait, wait. You know what? Ross, let's - let's switch places. You get in the middle. No un-, ya know, unless this looks like we're trying to cover something up.","Alright, shall we?"
Oh hi kids. Hi darling.,"Monica, Monica, you could come in straddling him, they still wouldn't believe it. We're here."
Oh thank you.,Happy birthday dad.
Happy birthday.,Hi ma.
"Uh, actually mom, I think Monica thanked him for the both of us.","Well, you kids thank Dr. Burke for the ride?"
"Well, you kids take the train in?",
"Oh. Speaking of whom, I hear he's got some 20-year-old twinkie in the city.","No, Richard Burke gave them a ride."
"Sooo, Richard's shopping in the junior section.","Finger cramp. Oh God, sorry. Here, let me get that mom."
We just know she's got the IQ of a napkin.,Are we still on that?
,"She's probably not even very pretty, just young enough so that everything is still pointing up."
"I know, this is a great apartment.",Can you believe this place?
"Wow, there's my fantasy come true. No, seriously.","Ah, I was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you. So when you're in there it's like you're peein' with the Rockettes."
"Hey! We were just sayin', great apartment man.",Hey.
Huh?,Thanks. You want it?
"Yeah, can you see me in a place like this?","Yeah, I'm movin' to a bigger place. You should definitely take this one."
"Oh that's all right fellas, I saw a kitchen this morning - on TV. Stop talking. OK.",Why not? You hate park views and high ceilings? C'mon I'll show you the kitchen.
"C'mon, tell us.",
I am not telling you guys anything.,"Yeah, is she really 20."
"Dad, you really don't want to do that.","C'mon Rich, it's my birthday, let me live vicariously."
"Jack, would you let it go?","Ahh, what's a little mid-life crisis between friends?"
"Guys. Seriously, it is not like that.","Look, I know what you're going through. When I turned 50 I got the Porsche. You... you got your own little speedster."
"Dad, I beg you not to finish that sentence.","Tell you what, maybe one of these weekends you can borrow the car and I cou. . ."
,What? I'm kidding. You know I'd never let him touch the Porsche.
Well I. . .,"OK Rach, which, which lily? This lily or that lily?"
"Alright, blonde girl, you're in room two, not so blonde girl, you're with me.","I like this lily. It's more open, ya know, and that's like my mom. She had a more open, giving spirit. Ooh, Foghorn Leghorn, ooh."
Uh-huh.,Here we go.
Uh-huh.,You're not going?
"No. Well, yeah, maybe.",What? Is it - is this 'cause of what Ross said?
What's 1922?,"I don't believe this. Is this how this relationship's gonna work? Ross equals boss. I mean, c'mon what is this, 1922?"
"Yes I do, it's just that Ross is. . .","Just, you know, long time ago. Well, when men used to tell women what to do - a lot. And then there was suffrage, which is a good thing but is sounds horrible. Do you want to get this tattoo?"
No.,"OK, hey, HEY. Is your boyfriend the boss of you?"
You?,"OK, who is the boss of you?!!"
,No. You are the boss of you. Now you march your heinie in there and get that heart tattooed on your hip. GO!!
I'm a twinkie.,How ya doin'?
"Oh, this is so hard.",Really? I'm a hero.
Maybe we should just tell your parents first.,"Yeah, I know. I hate it too. Look, maybe we should just tell them."
"God, you are so lucky. I mean, I mean. . . you know what I mean.",My parents are dead.
Alright.,"I know, I know. Just hang in there, OK. OK, I'll go out first, alright."
"Thank you Richard, I appreciate the support.","Judy, going to the bathroom, good for you."
I have no idea. Did you know Richard has a twinkie in the city?,"Honey. Honey, have you seen my Harmon Kilerbrew bat? Bob doesn't believe I have one."
I just never would have pictured Richard with a bimbo.,I know. He's like a new man. It's like a scene from Cocoon.
Really.,"Apparently, he told Johnny Shapiro that she's quite a girl. In fact, he told Johnny that he thinks he's falling in love with her."
"So Jack, you ever think about trading me in for a younger model?","I tell you, I've never seen him this happy."
Oh Jack stop.,Of course not. With you it's like I've got two 25-year-olds.
,"C'mon, it's my birthday."
"Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. You want it.",Can we drop this? I am not interested in the guy's apartment.
Well it wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while.,"Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I love."
What?,"Alright, you want the truth? I'm thinkin' about it."
"Woah, woah, woah. I don't need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.","I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore."
"Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it.","What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie."
Well then maybe you should take it.,Well that's how I feel.
Fine with me.,Well then maybe I will.
,"Great. Then you'll be able to spend more quality time with your real friends, the spoons."
Almost time for cake.,Who's drink can I freshen?
You remember that video I found of mom and dad?,"Mon, Mon, are you OK?"
"Well, I just caught the live show.",Yeah.
,Eww.
What?,Hey there.
"Humm, really?","Nothing, I just heard something nice about you."
"Uhh, not that I know of.",Richard. Richard. Your son isn't seeing anyone is he?
That - that's an idea.,"Well, I was thinking, why doesn't he give Monica a call?"
Oh?,"Well, actually, I'm already seeing someone."
Ohh.,Oh?
"Mom, there are so many people in my life. Some of them are seeing people and some of them aren't. Is that crystal?","She never tells us anything. Ross, did you know Monica's seeing someone?"
"Well, uh, he's a doctor.","So, who's the mystery man?"
"No, a doctor of meat. Of course he's a real doctor. And he's handsome, and he's sweet, and know you'd like him.",A real doctor?
"Mom, it's OK.",Well that's wonderful. . . I
Jack. Could you come in here for a moment? NOW!,It is Judy.
I'll take that dad.,Found it.
"That's impossible, he's got a twinkie in the city.",It seems your daughter and Richard are something of an item.
You're the twinkie?,"Dad, I'm the twinkie."
"Al-alright, l-look you guys, this is the best relationship I've been in. . .",She's not a twinkie.
"Yes, a relationship. For your information I am crazy about this man.","Oh please, a relationship."
Yes.,Really?
"Dad, dad this is a good thing for me. Ya know, and you even said yourself, you've never seen Richard happier.",Am I supposed to stand here and listen to this on my birthday?
Upstairs in the bathroom right before you felt up mom.,When did I say that?
"Oh that looks so good, oh I love it.",
"Ahh. OK, let's see yours again.","I know, so do I. Oh Phoebe, I'm so glad you made me do this. OK, lemme se yours."
"Oh OK. Oh no, oh it's gone, that's so weird, I don't know how-where it went.","Phoebe we just saw mine, let me see yours."
No.,You didn't get it?
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry.",Why didn't you get it?
"I know, I know, and I was gonna get it but then he came in with this needle and uh, di-, did you know they do this with needles?","Phoebe, how would you do this to me? This was all your idea."
,"Really? You don't say, because mine was licked on by kittens."
Hey.,Hey.
Yeah me too.,"Hey listen, I'm sorry about what happened. . ."
Yeah. So do we need to hug here or. . .,I know. Yeah.
So I got ya something.,"No, we're alright."
Lick away my man.,Plastic spoons. Great.
What?,"These'll go great in my new place. You know, 'till I get real ones."
"No-no, I mean what, what's this about your new place?","Well, I can't use these forever. I mean, let's face it, they're no friend to the environment."
Well I didn't think that was serious. Ya know I thought that was just a fight.,I'm movin' out like we talked about.
"Well, there you go.","Well, it was a fight. . . based on serious stuff, remember. About how I never lived alone or anything. I just think it would be good for me, ya know, help me to grow or. . . whatever."
"Hey, no, I've never been lower or wetter. I'll be fine. I'll just turn your, uh, bedroom into a game room or somethin', you know, put the foosball table in there.","Hey, are you cool with this. I mean, I don't want to leave you high and dry."
I did pay for half of it.,Woah. Why do you get to keep the table?
"Alright I'll tell you what, I'll play you for it.","Yeah. And uh, I paid for the other half."
Your little men are gonna get scored on more times than your sister.,"Alright, you're on. I can take two minutes out of my day to kick your ass."
,"Woah, woah, woah, woah. Which sister?"
"No, it's been a long time since your dad and I went running.","So, are you sorry that I told them?"
Oh. Well did you get it? Let me see.,Oh.
No he went out to get pizza.,Is Ross here?
That's great.,"Oh really, OK."
"Wanna see mine, wanna see mine?",Very tasteful.
What? You didn't get one.,Yes.
What're we looking at? That blue freckle?,"OK, well then what is this?"
"That is not a tattoo, that is a nothing. I finally got her back in the chair, bairly touched her with a needle, she jumped up screaming, and that was it.","OK, that's my tattoo."
"Oh, what a load of crap. That is a dot. Your mother is up in heaven going, 'Where the hell is my lily, you wuss?' OK, Phoebe, that is not a tattoo, this is a tattoo.","OK, hi. For your information this is exactly what I wanted. This is a tattoo of the earth as seen from a great distance. It's the way my mother sees me from heaven."
Maybe. But just a little one. Phoebe got the whole world.,You got a tattoo?
Well?,Lemme see.
Really?,Well it's really. . . sexy. I wouldn't have thought it would be but. . . wow.
I guess.,"Yeah, so uh, is it sore or can you do stuff?"
,"Hey, save us some pizza."
Stop talkin' to your men.,"Get out of the corner. Pass it, pass it."
Congratulations.,Yes! And the table is mine.
"Hey, you guys are still gonna come visit me, right?",
I know you're just moving uptown but I'm really gonna miss you.,"Oh yeah, you got the big TV. We'll be over there all the time. . . except when we are here."
"Yeah, who's gonna eat all our food, and tie up our phone lines, and - is that my bra? What the hell you doin' with my bra?","I know, how can you not be accross the hall anymore."
"Yeah, I remember.","Oh no-no, it's uh, it's not what you think. We uh, we used it to, you know, fling water balloons off the roof. Remember that, those junior high kids couldn't even get theirs accross the street."
"So, uhh, em, you want me to uh, give you a hand with the foosball table?","Hey, let's bring the rest of these down to the truck."
Thanks.,"Naa, you keep it, you need the practice."
"Yeah, right, yeah, I guess so.","So, I guess this is it."
"Well, I'm guessing uh, tonight at the coffee house.","Listen, uh, I don't know when I'm gonna see you again."
Yeah.,"Right, yeah. OK. Um, take care."
Huh? So whaddya think? Casa de Joey. Huh? I decorated it myself.,

"Hey, excellent, excellent water-table thing.","Hey, nice pillow. So now tell me, is this genuine Muppet skin?"
"Yeah, well me too, yeah. I think that's the challenge.","Thanks, yeah. I love this but ya know what, it makes me wanna pee."

"Anyway, OK, now promise you won't like, freak out and say how great this is until I'm done, OK.","Now wait a minute, I claimed you in the name of France four years ago."
"OK. I just met this producer of this like, teeny record company, who said that I have a very fresh, offbeat sound and she wants to do a demo of Smelly Cat.",OK.
"I told you not to do that yet. And, she wants to do a video.",
"I'm not done yet, OK. God. OK, if that goes well, they may even want to make an album.",
,I'm done now.
Get the what?,"Oh God. Ross, OK, if you care about me at all, you will get the pie out of the man's hood."
What're you doing?,"Pie in the hood, pie in the hood. Go."
,"I'm sorry, my pie was, was in your hood. Now I just have to get the coffee out of that guy's pants and I'll be back in the hospital by 7."
"Calm down, I'm blow drying.","Damnit Ross, get your butt out of the bathroom."
What's goin' on?,"Blow drying what, you have no hair."
"Well, you're not sixteen, you're both adults now.","Your boyfriend has been in there for over an hour. I can't believe it, it's like I'm living with him again. He's here when I go to sleep, he's here when I wake up, he's here when I want to use the shower, ughh. It's like I'm sixteen all over again ."
"Or ya know, he's rubber and you're glue.",GET OUT YOU DUFUS!!

"Hey, hey, they're runnin'","Well, how could anyone not be in love with Yasmine Blepe?"
,"See, this is the brilliance of the show. I say always keep them running. All the time, running. Run. Run Yasmine, run like the wind."
"I did. I thought it'd be great. I figured I'd have like, time alone with my thoughts but, ya know, it turns out I don't have as many thoughts as you'd think.",But I thought you wanted to live by yourself.
"You really think he'd take me? I mean, we had a pretty good talk last night but, when I moved out, I hurt him bad.","Joey, why don't you talk to Chandler about moving back?"
,"I promise you, he would definitely want you back."
"But we had one of the greatest talks we ever had last night. I mean it was, it was like when we first started living together.","I'm telling you, there's no way he's moving back."
"Look, Chandler, he has moved on, OK, you have to too.","Look, I know you don't want to hear this right now but, we've seen him in his new place, alright. And he's happy, he's, he's decorated."
"No. You're just gonna have to accept the fact that you're just friends now, OK, you're not... rommmates anymore.",But...
"OK Phoebe, you ready to try one?",
They're your backup singers... beind you.,"OK. Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat Oh woah, oh my God. I mean like, who was that?"

I'm just, I'm just not getting that everyone um, gets how smelly this cat acually is. I just think that maybe if we could talk about this, 'cause I need to feel that you really care about the cat."
,"Oh OK. So, um, the cat stinks but you love it, let's go."
I was.,"No, there is no way he was a velociraptor. No Tony, look at the cranial ridge, OK. If Dino was a velociraptor, he would have eaten the Flintstones. Yeah, yeah. Oh, were you takin' a nap?"

You wanna get out of my face?,"Look, you wanna get off my back?"
Give me that.,"Wait hold on Tony, hold on. Hello. Hi, yeah no, she's right here. Um hold on. Hi Tony, can I call you back? That's uh, that's my sister's boyfriend."

"It'll never last, he's just a rebound roommate.","Uh, Eddie something. He just met him."
Hey.,Hey.
,"Oh, check it out, oh check it out. It's Smelly Cat the video."
Oh my God.,"Now OK, I haven't seen it yet so, if you don't like it, well, so what, none of you ever made a video. OK."

"Oh, I am sorry but I am incredibly talented.","Pretty uhm, different huh?"
"Hi Joey, what's goin' on man?",

"Oh, ooh.","Alright, here you go my friend. Eggs a-la Eddie, huh?"

"Well I do, but uh, Eddie makes them this way and, well they're pretty darn good.","No I just uh, thought you liked your eggs with the bread with the hole in the middle, a-la me."
See ya.,"Well you guys, I'm outta here. See ya pals."

And now there's no juice. There's no juice f or the people who need the juice and want the juice. I need the juice."
"Alright, so what's it about?","Hey, this isn't about juice anymore, alright man."
Well I like both eggs equally.,"Eggs. Who's eggs do you like better, his or mine, huh?"
"Well what's the difference? Your eggs aren't here anymore, are they? You took your eggs and you left. You really expect me to never find new eggs?",Oh come on. Nobody likes two different kinds of eggs equally. You like one better than the other and I wanna know which.

"Fun? Fun, you think this is fun?","Why, why, why can't you stand me being here? I don't, I, we're just, ya know, we're just havin' fun."
"Ross, I hated you when we were kids.","Yeah, c'mon I mean I though, you know, I thought we're just foolin' around. Like when, uh, when we were kids."
"Yes. I hated you. I mean I, I, loved you in a 'you're my brother so I have to' kind of way, but basically, yeah, I hated your guts.",You hated me when we were kids?
"Because, you were mean to me and you, you teased me and you always, always got your way.",Why did you hate me?
Duh-huh!,And that wasn't fun for you?
Now I love you. And not just 'cause I have to.,I can't believe you hated me.
Yeah. You're just gonna have to stop pissing me off.,Really?
Then I won't have to kill you.,I can do that.
"Yeah, thanks. You know what?","So you wanna watch uh, Entertainment Tonight?"
"If you really want to watch that Serengetti thing, you can.",What?
,Ohh... OK.
Hey.,
"Listen. You are not going to believe this but, that is not me singing on the video.",Hey.
Yes.,No.
"Well, OK, the record company sent over this piece of paper for me to sign, saying that it's OK for someone else to sing for me. That was my first clue.","Well, how did you find out?"
"Well, I can't work with people who would do this.",So what're you gonna do?
I mean this poor woman.,Sure.
"The voice woman. Ya know, I mean, she has a great voice but she doesn't have a video.",What woman?
"Well I have a video, you have to pay attention. No this, this voice woman, she's so talented but, according to the producer people, they said she doesn't have like the right look or something, ya know. I mean, it's like, she's like one of those an imals at the pound who like nobody wants 'cause they're not pretty enough or you know. Like, like some old dog who's just kind of like stinky and. Huuuuh, oh my God, she's smelly cat. Oh, oh that song has so many levels.","OK, Phoebs. But what about you?"
"Hey Eddie, you uh, wanna play some foosball?",
"Yeah o-, OK, alright. Doesn't matter, time for Baywatch.","No thanks man, I'm not uh, I'm not really into sports."
You don't like that show?,"Y-, y-, you like that show?"

"Oh o-, OK man.","I tell ya, I-, I'm gonna go read in my room for a little while."
"Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Everybody.",
Monica.,"Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, it's not your fault."
Chandler.,They won't take you to the vet.
Joey.,You're obviously not their favorite pet.
Rachel.,It may not be a bed of roses.
"Uh, Ross, those are the only lines we have, sorry. OK, you guys, once more.",And you're no friend to those with noses.
Oh Drake.,
"I'm sorry I'm late, what happened?",I'm sorry Amber. It's just like Brad to have to have the last word.
I want you Drake.,"We, we just wanna see the end."
What?,I know you do but you and I can never be together that way.
So what happens next?,There's something I never told you Amber. I'm actually your half- brother.
God that is good TV.,"Well, I get the medical award for separating the siamese twins. Then Amber and I go to Venezuela to meet our other half-brother, Ramone. And that's where I find the world's biggest emerald. It's really big but it's cursed."
"Phoebs, play with meeee.",
"Ya know Phoebs, don't feel so bad for 'em. After they're done playing, I break out the little plastic women and everybody has a pretty good time.","No. This game is grotesque. Twenty armless guys joined at the waist by a steel bar, forced to play soccer forever. Ahh, hello, human-rights violation."
"Ah he's a, he's not a big fan of foosball.",Why don't you play with your roommate?
"No he's, he's alright, just uh, he spends most of his time in his room.","Uh oh, ooh, are we not getting along with the new boy?"
We don't need to remedy that.,"Maybe that's because you haven't taken the time to get to know him. Let's remedy that, shall we?"
What was that?,"Oh yeah, it'll be fun."
"Yeah alright, that sounds alright.","Hi, um, I just thought that it would be fun if the three of us had some beers and got to know each other."
That was so lame.,"Oh good, ok. Oh nooo, I have to go because I'm late for my um, Green Eggs and Ham discussion group. Um tonight it's why he would not eat them on a train. Have fun bye."
"So, you uh, you think that Speed Racer guy gets a lot of tickets er?","I know, yeah. Ok, talk to him."
"That's good, that's good. So, so, so who broke up with who?",
"That's good man, when everybody knows that the uh, the capital of Cambodia is uh...",What're you kidding? I broke up with her. She actually thought that Sean Penn was the capital of Cambodia.
"Not Sean Penn. Alright, I, I've got a funny one, alright. My last girlfriend Tilly. Ok, we're eating breakfast, right, and I made all these pancakes, there was like 50 pancakes right. And all of the sudden she turns to me, alright, and she says, 'Eddie.' I say, 'yeah,' she says, 'Eddie, I don't want to see you anymore.' And it was literally like she had reached into my chest, ripped out my heart, and smeared it all over my life, ya know. And now there's like this incredible abyss, ya know, and I'm falling and I keep falling and I don't think I'm ever gonna stop. That uh, wasn't such a funny story, was it?",Well it's not Sean Penn.
"And a crusty old man said I'll do what I can and the rest of the rats played moroccas. That's it, thanks, good night.",
Great set tonight Phoebs.,"Phoebe's got another job, right?"
"Well, we should probably get going.",I know.
"Ya know, I was thinking. Ya know how we always stay at your apartment? Well, I thought maybe tonight we'd stay at my place.","Um, we should go too, I got patients at 8 in the moring."
"Well, maybe you don't need them.","I don't know, I don't have my jammies."
"Shut up, I'm happy.","My baby sister, ladies and gentlemen."
"Oh, thank you Phoebs. That's very sweet.","Oh, this is so nice. Alright I have to make a speech. I just wanna say that of all the guys that Monica has been with, and that is a lot, I like you the best."
"Hear that? She likes me best, and apparently there've been a lot.",Ok.
Phoebe's dead.,"Not a lot, Phoebe's kidding, Phoebe's crazy."
Hi.,
I'm looking for Eddie Minowick.,Hi.
Thanks.,"Oh, uh, he's not here right now, uh, I'm Chandler, can I take a message, or, or a fishtank?"
I'm Tilly.,"Oh, oh, c'mon in."
I gather by that oh that he told you about me.,Oh.
He's kind of intense huh?,"Oh yeah, your uh, name came up in a uh, conversation that terrified me to my very soul."
A little what?,"Yes. Hey, can I ask you, is Eddie a little..."
Hello Tilly.,Bit country? C'mon in here you roomie.
That's very thoughtful of you. It's very thougtful.,"Eddie, I just came by to drop off your tank."
Bye-bye.,"Well, ok then. I'm gonna go. Bye."
"So, we gettin' a fish?",Bye.
,You had sex with her didn't you?
"Oh, ooh, Soap Opera Digest, oh that's one of my favorite digests.","Phoebs, check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out."
"Ok, ok, ok. Ooh, hey 'new doc on the block, Days of Our Lives' Joey Tribbiani.' Ooh, cool picture.","Page 42, page 42, page 42."
"Hey is this true, that you write a lot of your own lines?","Ooh, I look good."
"Ohh, ok, I see what you did there. Aren't you afraid though, that the writers are gonna be kinda mad when they read this?","Uh, well, kinda yeah. Like, remember last week when Alex was in the accident? Well the line in the script was, 'If we don't get this woman to a hospital, she's going to die.' But I made it, ' If this woman doesn't get to a hospital, she's not gonna live.'"
,"Huh? Never really thought about the writers. The scripts just kinda come to my house. But you know what? This makes me look good, which makes the show look good, which makes the writers look good so how could they be mad about that?"
,"Makes up most of his lines. Son-of-a-. Yeah, well, write this jerkweed."
"Uhh, I don't know, I just bring the scripts.","I fall down an elevator shaft? What the hell does this mean, I fall down an elevator shaft?"
Right. Could you sign this?,"They can't kill me, I'm Francesca's long lost son."
I don't think that's gonna affect the plot of the show.,"No. No way, I'm not signing that."
"Er, uh, I'm just gonna go. Sorry.",How can they do this to me?
"Well it wasn't that many guys. I mean, if you consider how many guys there actually are, it's a very small percentage.",
G'night.,"Hey, it's not that big a deal, I was just curious."
"Alright, before I tell you, uh, why don't you tell me how many women you've been with.",Night Richard. Good luck Mon.
"Two? TWO? How is that possible? I mean, have you seen you?",Two.
"Two it is. Ok, time for bed, I'm gonna go brush my teeth.","Well, I mean what can I say? I, I was married to Barbara for 30 years. She was my high school sweetheart, now you, that's two."
"Ok, it is definitely less than a ballpark.","Woah, woah, no wait a minute now. C'mon it's your turn. Oh c'mon. Ya know, I don't need the actual number, just a ballpark."
"Tell me about it. So what, what's your magic number?","Wow, I am so glad I'm not Monica right now."
"C'mon, you know everyone I've been with. All, both of them.",Uhhhooo.
Better not be doin' these in order.,"Well, there's you."
"Oh yes, the weenie from Torrini.","Ok, uh, Billy Dreskin, Pete Carney, Barry, and uh, oh, Paolo."
Really?,"Oh honey, are you jealous of Paolo? Oh, c'mon, I'm so much happier with you than I ever was with him."
,"Oh please. That Paolo thing was barely a relationship. All it really was was just, ya know, meaningless animal sex. Ok, ya know, that sounded soooo much better in my head."
"That's very interesting, ya know, 'cause that's exactly what someone who slept with her would say.","Eddie, I didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend."
Where's Buddy?,"This is nuts. This is crazy. She came over for like two minutes, dropped off a fish tank, and left, end of story."
"My fish, Buddy.",Buddy?
"Oh, this is, this is unbelievable. I mean, first you sleep with my ex-girlfriend then you insult my inteligenct by lying about it and then you kill my fish, my Buddy?",There was no fish when she dropped it off.
,Hey I didn't kill your fish. Look Eddie... Would you look at what I'm doin' here. That can't be smart. So we're just gonna take this guy right off ya and put him here in Mr. Pocket. Tangellon?
Well yeah.,That's it? That's the giant number you were afraid to tell me?
You really ok with it?,"Well, that's not bad at all. I mean, you had me thinkin it was like a fleet."
"Oh, yay. Ok about that two.","Oh honey, I'm fine."
"Well, it just seems like a really small number.","What? Alright, what about my two?"
"And, well, don't you have a lot of wild oats to sew? Or is that what you're doing with me? Oh my God, am I an oat?","Right, and..."
But you've only slept with two people.,"Honey, you are not an oat. I, I mean I don't know, I, I guess I'm just not an oat guy. I've only slept with women I've been in love with."
"Wow. Oh wow. You know I love you too, right.",Right.
"Ross, Ross, please listen to me. Ross, you are so much better for me than Paolo ever was. I mean you care about me, you're loving, you make me laugh.",Now I do.
"God, Ross, look, what you and I have is special, all Paolo and I ever had was...","Oh, hey, if I make you laugh, here's an idea, why don't you invite Paulo over and have a little romp in the sack and I'll just stand in the corner and tell knock-knock jokes."
"Ok, Ross, try to hear me. Ok, I, hey, I'm not gonna lie to you. Ok, it was good with Paolo.","Animal sex, animal sex? So what're you saying, I mean, you're saying that like, there's nothing between us animal at all. I mean there's not even like, uhm, a little animal, not even, not even like, like chipmunk sex?"
"But, what you and I have is so much better. Ok, we have tenderness, we have intimacy, we connect. Ya know, I swear, this is the best I have ever had.",Knock-knock.
"Oh, hi.",Until now.
"Oh my God, honey that's great.",Hi. Richard just told me he loves me.
Oh they're in the top drawer. Hurry.,I know. I just can't find...
Ooooh yeah.,You need one too?
Monica.,There's only one.
Rachel. Hey.,"Hi. Uh, we'll be right there, we're just trying to decide something."
"Good, good, good. So, is uh, was your moustache, did, used to be different?",Hey. They're just trying to decide somehting.
"Oh. How do you uh, ya know, keep it so neat?",No.
Oh. And what do you call that?,I have a little comb.
"Ok, I, I will do your laundry for one month.",A moustache comb.
"Ok, ok, ok, I will, I will, I, hey, I will clean the apartment for two months.",No.
Agghhh.,"Alright, I tell you what, I'll give this to you now if you can tell me where we keep the dustpan."
Rock-paper-scissors?,So were you in Nam?
One two three.,Yeah.
"Fine, go have sex.",Yeesss.
"No, no way. You've got it totally the other way around my friend. John Voit was...","No. You have got it completely wrong. John Savage was deerhunter, no legs, John Voit was coming home, couldn't feel his legs."
"What, what oh....",Honey.
"It's not gonna happen. They're doing it tonight, we can do it tomorrow.",Shall we?
,"Uh, in the future, if I could see the schedule beforehand..."
Why?,"So, when I woke up this morning, he'd stolen all the insoles out of my shoes."
Why would you kill his fish?,Because he thinks I slept with his ex-girlfriend and killed his fish.
"Chandler honey, I'm sorry. Ok, can we watch Joey's show now please?","Because sometimes, Phoebe after you sleep with someone, you have to kill the fish."
"Wait, he's not here yet.",Yeah.
Yeah.,"So, he's on the show, he knows what happens."
"Oh, I'm fine about my problem now, by the way.",Alright.
"Amber, I want you to know that I'll always be there for you, as a friend and as your brother.",Oh good.
"Hard day huh? First the medical award, this.",Oh Drake.
"Dr. Remore, report to first floor emergency, stat.",Some guys are just lucky I guess.
"No, no, they only said you.","Well then, uh, I uhh, guess that's me. Anyone else need to go on the elevator? Dr. Horton, Dr. Wong?"
I love you Drake.,"Oh, ok. Alright."
"Drake, look out.","Yeah, whatever. Oh no."
Did they just kill off Joey?,Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
,No. Now maybe.
Joey.,C'mon.
I don't feel like talkin.,Open up. We want to talk to you.
We're worried about you.,"Oh c'mon Joey, we care about you."
Sorry Joey,And some of us really have to pee.
"Listen, sorry about your death, that really sucks.",Hey.
How could you not tell us?,We came over as soon as we saw.
"Well, maybe they can find a way to bring you back.","I don't know, I was kinda hopin' no one would ever find out."
"But Joey, you're gonna be fine. You don't need that show, it was just a dumb soap opera.","Naa, they said that when they found my body, my brain was so smashed in that the only doctor that could have saved me was me. Supposed to be some kind of irony or somethin."
"Yes, I was going to incorporate that. Oh good, here's Monica, she'll have something nice to say.","Phoebe, this was the greatest thing that ever happened to me."
It's gonna be ok. You know that?,"Um, I straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew. What? To me that's nice."
I'm sorry man.,"No, I don't. It's like, ya know, you work your whole life for somethin' and you think that when you get it it's never gonna be as good as you thought it would be. But this so was. Ya know, it changed everything. Like the other day, I got this credit card application, and I was pre- approved. Huh? I've never been pre-approved for anything in my life."
"No, that means nothin to me.","Yeah, Joey honey, I don't know if this'll mean anything to you but you'll always be pre-approved with us."
Uhhhaahh.,
"Yeah alright. What're these, raisins?","Pecan sandy, just made em."
"Listen Eddie, um, I've been thinking about our current living situation and uh, why are you smiling?","Uh, sure, why not."
"Well that's not an, even a real fish. No, that's a goldfish cracker.","I got a little surprise, look. There's a new fishie. I named him uh, Chandler, you know, after, after you."
"Ok, good night. You big freak of nature.",What's you point man?
,
Hey.,Hey.
"Ohh, brisk tonight.",Hey.
Let's never speak of this.,Oh man.
,You got it.
Hey Eddie. Daahh!! What're you doin' here?,
Why?,"Nothin' roomie, just watchin' you sleep."
I can't sleep now.,"Makes me feel um, peaceful, heh-heh, please."
"No, look, that's it, it's over, I want you out, I want you out of the apartment now.",You want me to sing?
Hannibal Lecter...better roommate than you.,"Woah, woah, woah, what're, what're you talkin' about man."
I didn't realize that.,"No. See now I don't think you're being fair. I mean one night you see me and you get scared, I mean, what about all the other nights when you don't see me, huh? What about last night when you went and got a drink of water and I was nice enough to hide behind the door, what's that about, huh?"
GET OUT NOW!!,Yeah.
Yes please.,"Ok, you really want me out?"
I want you out.,"Ok, then I want to hear you say it, I, I want to hear you say you want me out."
Where did you hear it from before?,"No no no, I wanna hear it from your lips."
I heard that.,"Oh, right, all right, you know what pallie I understand, consider me gone, you know what, I'll be out by the time you get home from work tomorrow."
Hey.,
"Hey. Whe-ell, look at you, finally got that time machine workin' huh?",Hey.
A mirror?,"Seriously, you like it? This guy was sellin' them on 8th avenue and I looked at 'em and I though, you know what I don't have?"
"Wow, for a guy who's recently lost his job, you're in an awfully good mood.","Fine, make fun. I think it's jaunty."
Cache? Jaunty?,"Hey, I'll be alright. I mean it's not like I'm starting from sqare one. I was Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives. Heh? I mean that's gotta have some kind of cache."
Hey.,Chandler gave me word of the day toilet paper. I'm gonna get some coffee.
Hey.,Hey.
"Oh my God, it was incredible.","Oooh, so so so, did you read the book?"
"Woah, woah, woah, what book is this?",Didn't it like totally speak to you?
"Yeah and oh, and but there's, there's wind and the wind can make us Goddesses. But you know who takes out wind? Men, they just take it.",Rachel you have to read this book. It's called Be Your Own Windkeeper. It's about how women need to become more empowered.
"Ya-huh, all the time, cause they are the lightning bearers.",Men just take out wind?
Yeah.,Wow.
"It is nothing like the Hobbit. It's like reading about every relationship I've ever had, except for Richard.","Well that sounds kinda cool, kinda like The Hobbit."
No.,"Oh yes, no, Richard would never steal your wind."
Yes. But all the other ones.,"No, 'cause he's yummy."
Anybody want a croan.,"Oh yes. Oh and, the part about how they're always like drinking from out pool of inner power, but God forbid we should take a sip."
,"Ok, this is a typical lightning-bearer thing. Right there, it's like, um, 'Hello, who wants one of my fallic shaped man cakes?'"
"So, you're not mad at me for getting fired and everything?",Don't worry about it already. Things happen.
"No, can we get back to me?","Joey, look at me, look at me. Do I have lipstick on my teeth?"
Alright. Cab driver number two?,"Look honey, people get fired left and right in this business. I already got you an audition for Another World."
But I was Dr. Drake Remoray. How can I go from bein' a neurosurgeon to drivin' a cab?,You're welcome.
"But this is a two line part, it's like takin' a step backwards. I'm not gonna do this.","Things change, roll with em."
I'm sorry. See ya.,"Joey, I'm gonna tell you the same thing I told Al Minser and his pyramid of dogs. Take any job you can get and don't make on the floor."
"Oh, God, oh, God, I mean it's just so.",
"Uhh, I mean this is like reading about my own life. I mean this book could have been called 'Be Your Own Windkeeper Rachel'.",Isn't it.
Hey you guys.,I don't think it would have sold a million copies but it would have made a nice gift for you.
"Uh, sweetie we've gotta go.",Hey.
No?,NO!
Actually it's the movie theatre that has the time schedule. So you don't miss the beginning.,"No, why do we always have to do everything according to your time table?"
You go girl. I can't pull that off can I?,"No, see this isn't about the movie theatre, this is about you stealing my wind."
"Yes, my wind. How do you expect me to grow if you won't let me blow?","Excuse me, your, your, your wind?"
"Ok, I just, I just really need to be with myself right now. I'm sorry.","You, you know I, I don't, have a- have a problem with that."
"You're right, I don't have to apologize. Sorry. Damnit!","Um-um, um-um."
What is it?,
"See, this is why I don't date women who read. Uh-oh.","I, I don't know, it's got all this stuff about wind and trees and there's some kind of sacred pool in it. I mean, I don't really get it but she's, she's pretty upset about it."
It's my VISA bill. Envelope one of two. That can't be good.,"What, what's that?"
Oh my God.,"Open it, open in."
"Look at this, how did I spend so much money?",Woah.
Ahh.,"Uh Joey, that's just the minumum amount due, that's your total due."
"My animals. Hey the guy said they suited me, he spoke with an accent, I was all confused. I don't know what I'm gonna do.","What, woah, woah, $3500 at porcelain safari?"
What?,Well I guess you can start by drivin a cab on Another World.
That's a two line part.,That audition.
So what.,"Joey, you owe $1100 at I Love Lucite."
"Hey, look, I don't need you getting all judgemental and condescending and pedantic.","So suck it up man, it's a job, it's money."
Yeah.,Toilet paper?
"Well knock it off, you're supposed to be my friend.","Look, I'm not being any of those things, ok, I'm just being realistic."
"Well then tell me things like, 'Joey you'll be fine,' and, 'Hang in there,' and, and, 'Somethin' big's fonna come along, I know it.'",I am your friend.
"Hey Ross, I'm aware of what I owe.",But I don't know it. What I do know is that you owe $2300 at Isn't it Chromantic.
"Look, I don't wanna hear this right now.","Ok, well then get some sense. I mean it took you what, 10 years to get that job, who knows how long it's gonna be till you get another."
Well don't just say.,"Huh, I'm just saying..."
Ok.,"Ya know, maybe, maybe I should just go."
"I don't need to think about it. I was Dr. Drake Remoray. That was huge. Big things are gonna happen, you'll see. Ross, you still there?","Ok. I'll see ya later. Just think about it, ok."

"Oh yeah, that's right, look I got us a new goldfish. He's a lot fiestier that the last one.","Look Eddie, aren't you forgetting anything?"
"Well, not unless it's got something to do with dehydrating my man because right now I'm a dehydrating maniac!","Maybe 'cause the last one was made by Pepperidge Farm. Look Eddie, isn't there something else you're supposed to be doing right now?"
"Ah-ah-ah, you know what that is?",Look you have to help me out here. I thought we had a deal. I thought by the time...

No help required Chico.,You want some help.
"All the way to the airport huh? You know that's over 30 miles, that's gonna cost you about so bucks.",
What?,"Excuse me, that's 50 bucks."
"Ohh, you know what it is? It's smudgy 'cause they're fax pages. Now when I was on Days of Our Lives as Dr. Drake Remoray, they'd send over the whole script on real paper and everything.",Five oh dollars.
"And, and just so you know, if you wanted to expand this scene like, like have the cab crash or somethin', I could attend to the victims 'cause I have a background in medical acting.",That's great.
"No no, uh, don't thank me for comin' in. Uh, at least let me finish. Uh, we could take the expressway but uh, this time of day you're better off taking the budge. You were goin' for the word bridge there weren't ya. I'll have a good day.","Ok, listen, thanks for coming in."

Only 'cause you took up half the circle.,"Huuh, alright, Danny Arshak, ninth grade. Oh, c'mon Rach, you know the bottle was totally pointing at me."
Well not when they find out you slept with Jason Hurley an hour after he broke up with Monica.,Listen to you two. It's so sad. Looks like I'm gonna be going to the goddess meetings alone.
,One hour? You are such a leaf blower.
"Oh my God, what's goin' on?","Oh hey uh, be careful with that 3-D last supper, Judas is a little loose."
"No look I wasn''t right, that's what I came here to tell you. I was totally hung up on, on my own stuff. Listen, I'm someone who needs the whole security thing, ya know. To know exactly where my next paycheck is coming from buy you, you don't need that and that's amazing to me. I could never do what you do Joey.",They're takin all my stuff back. I guess you were right.

,Thanks Ross. I really like that bird though...I'll take the dog though.
We didn't order cake.,Here are your cakes.
You're right.,"No, I know, they're from me. Look you guys this is not good. I mean we have enough trouble with guys stealing our wind without taking it from each other."
I love you goddesses. I don't ever want to suck your wind again.,You know.
We're good.,Thank you. So are we good?
Yeah.,We're good?
"Ding dong, the psycho's gone.","Ok, let me take these cakes back 'cause they're gonna take that out of my paycheck."
"Yes, yes I actually saw him leave. I mean that guy is standing in the window holding a human head. He is STANDING IN THE WINDOW HOLDING A HUMAN HEAD!",Are you sure this time?
There is no alley behind Macy's.,"Check it out man, I tore it off some mannaquin in the alley behind Macy's."

Absolutely.,A little foos?
Ah that's a cantelope.,What happened to the foosball?
"Hey look, are we gonna have to bring this out every time Ross comes over?",
"I'm gonna hold him a different way. Look I don't understand, if you hated it so much, why did you buy it in the first place?",He paid a lot of money for it.
"So is he housetrained or is he gonna leave little bathroom tiles all over the place? Stay. Good, STAY! Good fake dog.","Well, I had a whole ceramic zoo thing goin' over there but now, without the other ones, it just looks tacky."
Hey. Watcha guys doin?,
"Why are you guys so upset? It's Old Yeller, it's a happy movie.",Monica's making us watch Old Yeller.
What're you talkin' about?,What?
"Yeah but Phoebs, what about the end?","C'mon, happy family gets a dog, frontier fun."
That's not the end.,What when Yeller saves saves the family from the wolf and everyone's happy?
What about the part where he has rabies?,Yu-huh. That's when my mother would shut off the TV and say 'The end'.
"Uh, Phoebe, I don't think your mom would want you to see what's about to happen.","He doesn't have rabies, he has babies. That's what my mom said."
,"What, what's about to happen? I've never seen this part before. Hey, Travis, watcha doin' with that gun? Oh no, no no Travis, put down the gun. No no no no, he he's your buddy, he's your Yeller, no, no no, the end, THE END."
"Ya know, one of these times you're gonna really be naked and we're not gonna come over.","Hey, have you guys eaten, because uh, Richard and I just finished and we've got leftovers... Chicken and potatoes... What am I wearing?...Actually, nothing but rubber gloves."
"Well, how do you find clothes that fit?","Alright, I've got a leg, three breasts and a wing."
"Alright, for the bizillionth time, yes I see other women in shower at the gym, and no I don't look.","Oh, hey, Monica, we've got a question."
"Yeah, Ross can't go so it's between my friend Eric Prower who has breath issues and Dan with the poking. 'Did you see that play? Do you want some more beer? Is that Spike Lee?'","No, not that one. We're trying to figure out who to bring to the Knicks game tonight, we have an extra ticket."
"Ok, uh, hey Richard, if you had an extra ticket to the Knicks game and you had to choose between a friend who smells and one who bruises you who would you pick?","Ok. Hey, why don't you ask Richard?"
"Ok, that's Eric.","Wow. Well being a huge Knicks fan myself, I think you should take someone who's a huge Knicks fan."
"I meant, why don't you take Richard to the game? What?",Glad to be of help. Matches.
C'mon. Keeps his fingers to himself and he's always minty fresh.,I don't know.
"So what, he's a little older, big deal, I mean he's important to me. Ya know if you ask him, he might take you on his Jag.","I don't know, Richard's really nice and everything, uh, it's just that we don't know him really well, ya know, and plus he's, ya know, old -er than some people, but, uh, younger than some buildings."
"Ok, this could be tough.",How do we say yes now and make it seem like we're not doin' it just to ride in the cool car?
"Ooh, you almost had it.","Ok ok ok ok. Monica, we'll bring him, but only if he takes the Jaguar."
"No no, you're fine, you're fine.",
Hi.,Hello
Hi honey.,Hey.
What?,Oh you guys are not gonna believe what happened.
"Ok, we were sitting over there playing on the floor and he grabs the table and he pulls himself up. He pulled himself up. Standing man. I'm sorry you guys missed it but I did tape it so it you guys want to see it.",What?
You can watch our tape if you want.,"Uhh, we know, he already did it last week."
"Actually, he is getting closer on the talking thing. He can't quite say mama yet, but once he said yumen.","I don't believe this. I miss, I miss the first time of everything. I missed, what, the first time he rolled over, the first time he crawled. What else did I miss? Has he spoken yet, is he driving, does he have a favorite liquour?"
Great. That would be fine.,"Ooh, I, I'm so sick of missing stuff. Ya know, I want him for more than, than a day, I want him for a whole weekend. No listen , I mean, I feel like-"
"Oh shout, that would have been fun.","Really? I mean, I, I had a whole speach prepared."
,"Oh look, did, did you just see that? Did you see? He just waved, he just waved, he's never waved before, you've never waved before. Yes he has. Very good."
"Hey Phoebs, whatcha got there?",Hey.
"Wow, all you need now is The Killing Fields and some guacamole and you've got yourself a part-ay.","Ok, Love Story, Brian's Song, and Terms of Endearment."
Hey.,"Yeah, I talked to my grandma about the Old Yeller incident, and she told me that my mom used to not show us the ends of sad movies to shield us from the pain and sadness. You know, before she killed herself."
Hey.,Hey.
"Yeah right after we stole his lunch money and gave him a wedgie. What's the matter with you, he's parking the car.","Hey. Where is he, where's Richard? Did you ditch him?"
Your boyfriend is so cool.,So'd you guys have fun?
"Yeah, he let us drive his Jaguar. Joey for 12 blocks, me for 15.",Really?
"Oh, what about that thing he did when he tipped the guy who showed us to our seats. You never even saw the money, it was like this. Hey Chandler, thanks for showing us to our seats .","Wow, he must like you the best."
No problem. Hey Chandler,"You're welcome. Hey Joey, thanks for parking the car ."
Ok.,I think they get it.
He-he-eyy.,There's the man.
Ok. He kept my dollar.,"Hey, you're gettin' better. I'm gonna keep this by the way."
"So your first whole weekend without Ben, what're you guys gonna do?",
"Yeah, a woman I went to college with just became the first female blacksmith down there.","Uh, we're going down to Colonial Williamsburg."
Think I better go before mommy starts weeping.,"Well, ya know, they're a little behind the times in Colonial Williamsburg."
We love you. Buy.,Buy mommy.
Ross.,"Have a good time. Ok, Ben."
"Look. Joey, do you know we can see you from here?",Yeah.
"Well for starters, you may want to light it and lose the spatula.",How come Richard looks so much cooler with one of these than me?
"Not like him, per-se, just not un-like him.","You know what, I think it's cute, you trying to be more like Richard."
"Just tryin' somethin' here, ya know.",Look it's the artist formerly known as Chandler.
"Oh we flipped for it. I got the cigar, he got the moustache. Figured if we both grew it, we'd look like dorks.","So Joey, why didn't you grow a moustache?"
"Hey listen, we've gotta go, I promised Richard we'd meet him downstairs.","Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine."
"Yeah, we're goin' to a Ranger game.",You're meeting Richard?
"Well, he told me he was going out with the guys, I just didn't know that you were the guys.","Yeah, didn't he tell ya?"
We're the guys.,You hear that? We're the guys.
Thank you.,With that moustache doesn't Chandler remind you of Aunt Sylvia?
"Hi, we're visitiing. It's Ben and his da-da. Da-da. Can you say da-da? Look, I'm gonna tell your momies you said it anyway so you might as well try.",
"Naa. A while ago I got a sah out of him, which I thought, ya know, might turn into sah-condary caregiver but... Hey, would you uh, would you hold him for a sec, 'cause I, I gotta take this off.",No luck huh?
What're you doing?,"Oh, yeah sure, Ok."
"Yeah, well, he's a baby not a bomb.","Uh, I'm holding Ben."
Well just hold him like you'd hold a football.,Ok.
"Ok, here, here. There we go.",This is how I would hold a football.
"It's alright, it's no big deal.","Ok, I'm sorry, I'm just not very good with babies. I mean I haven't been around them, I mean, you know, since I was one."
"Yeah, definitely, I'm sure you'll feel totally different when it's our baby.",Really?
What?,What?
"Uhh, yeah. I mean, actually I kinda think that we'll have, we'll have two babies.",You think about stuff like that?
"Yeah. Ya know, a boy and a girl. Hopefully the girl will come first so Ben here won't feel too competitive.","Two, two babies?"
"Well, we won't wanna raise kids in the city so we'll probably move to uh, Scarsdale.",Then what's gonna happen?
"Yeah, that way I figure, ya know, we'll be far enough away from our parents that we don't have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit whenever we want. And yes, I know, the taxes are a little higher than, let's say, Nassau county but the school system's supposedly great.",Uh-huh.
Huh?,"Wow. Wow, that's great. Great. Ok, wow, you know what."
,"I'm off my break now so uh, um here you take this and um, I am gonna go pour these very nice people some coffee. Ok. Oh look at that, I don't have a pot. I don't have a pot. Well, hey, maybe I've got one at home, or in Scarsdale. Hey is that a door?"
"Hey Phoebs, what's happening?",Hey.
So you watched the movies huh?,"Oh, ok, murder, cancer, soccer teams eating each other in the Andes."
Charlotte who?,"Uh huh, what is happening to the world? I mean, no no no, 'cause ET leaves, and and Rocky loses, Charlotte dies."
"Alright, you wanna feel better?","With the web, the spider she dies, she does. She has babies and dies. It's like ya know, hey welcome home from the hospital, thud."
"Ok, here, watch this.",Yeah.
"So you can't lose, it's there in the title. Wonderfullness is baked right in.",It's a Wonderful Life. Yes I've heard of this.
"Uh, the guy was Lou Gehrig. Didn't you kinda see it coming?","Please, I almost fell for that with, uh, Pride of the Yankees, I thought I was gonna see a film about Yankee pride and then, boom, the guy gets Lou Gehrig's disease."
"Hey, big guy, game time.","Phoebe, just watch that, I promise it will resotre all your faith in humanity."
There's a game?,"Hey, be right there."
It's the basketball playoffs.,"Uh, yeah, I just got my pick-up sticks back from the shop. Bring your nerves of steel."
"Oh, no, honey, I mean, don't worry, I like hanging out with those guys. It's fun for me. They're different than my other friends, they don't start sentences with, 'You know who just died shoveling snow?'","Listen, um honey, I appreciate this but you don't have to keep hanging out with them for me, I mean, they have each other."
"Uh, it's the college playoffs.","Alright that's great, then just go. Go Knicks."
"Uh, they're not in it.","Oh, then go Vassar."
Ok.,"Ok, then just go."
Sure.,"Oh, why does this bother me so much? I mean I don't wanna be one of those people who tells their boyfriend they wanna spend 24 hours a day with them."
Does it matter? You're ultimately just gonna die or get divorced or have to blow your pets head off.,"It's just that he doesn't have that much free time, ya know, and I don't know, what do I do?"
Me too.,Aghh.
"Yeah well, Ross just made plans for the whole century.",I've got a question. Richard made plans again with the guys.
"Ok, what the hell happened back there?","Ya know what, I think I'm gonna go to my room and read Cosmo, maybe there's something helpful in there. Know what, at least maybe I can learn how to do an at home bikini wax with leftover Cristmas candles."
"Well I'm sorry, I think about stuff. Ya know, I mean, you're at work, you're assembling bones, your mind wanders.","I don't know, you tell me. One minute I'm holding Ben like a football, the next thing I know, I've got two kids, I'm living in Scarsdale complaining about the taxes."
"C'mon, what, you never think about our future?","Ross, you have planned out the next 20 years of our lives, we've been dating for six weeks."
"No, no, I mean, ya know, I, I read a book and there was a girl named Emily and I thought, I thought that might be good.","Yes, but I, I think about who's apartment we're gonna sleep at tomorrow night and, and where we're gonna have dinner next Saturday night. I do not think about what our childrens' names are gonna be. You know what our childrens names are gonna be."
The big book of childrens' names.,What was the book?
Yeah.,"Ok, Ross, Ross, ok listen, what we have is amazing."
Ok fine.,"But I do not want to have everything decided for me. I spent my whole life like that. It's what I had with Barry, that was one of the reasons I left. I, I like not knowing right now and I'm sorry if that scares you but if you want to be with me you are gonna have to deal with that."
We're not done.,Thank you.
"Ok, then you're gonna have to understand that you're with a guy who's not gonna stop planning his future with you because he knows that we're gonna end up together and if that scares you, tough, 'cause you're gonna have to deal with that.",I didn't know that.
"Good, 'cause I love you.","Fine, I will."
Yeah.,Oh yeah.
Well that's the first time we've said that.,Well I love you too.
"Well, I'm gonna kiss you.",Yes it is.
,Well you better.
Did you like it?,Hey. Oh thanks for the great movie tip.
"Alright, I'll give you the ear thing but don't you think the ending was pretty wonderful?","Oh yeah. You know, I don't know if I was happier when um George Bailey destroyed the family business or um, Donna Reid cried, or when the mean pharmacist made his ear bleed."
,"I didn't watch the ending, I was too depressed. It just kept getting worse and worse, it should have been called, ""It's a sucky life and just when you think it can't suck any more it does."""
"But... he gets it back, pass to the middle, lines it up and... BAM! Yes! Could that shot BE any prettier?",Kick save and... denied.
"Well, we had a table in college.",Man you are incredible.
Nice moustache by the way. When puberty hits that thing's really gonna kick in.,"Oh really, I didn't know they had foosball in the 1800's."
"Ok, just one more point.","Honey. Uh, not to sound too Florence Henderson but, dinner's on the table."
"See, that's why we don't let her play.",Score! Now can we go?
Um-hmm.,Is everything all right?
"Oh hey listen, don't be mad at him, it's our fault. I'm sorry we've been hoggin so much of his time.",Uh-oh.
Well.,"Yeah, he's just really great to hang around with."
"Uh, you guys see me as a dad?","No no, seriously, Chandler and I were just talkin about this. He is so much cooler than our dads. I mean, you know, our dad's are ok, ya know, but Richard is just- ow, ow. What are you kickin me for? Huh? I'm tryin to talk here."
No.,Oh yeah.
"Your just, your just clearly not familiar with our young persons vernacular. See, when we say dad, we mean buddy. We mean pal.",Nooooo.
"No no, seriously, Joey's my dad, Monica's my dad. I've even got some dads down at work.","Uh-huh, yeah."
Nighty-nite.,"That's fine. Well, your other dad and I are gonna go have a romantic evening and I guess I'll just see you kids around."
Not a dad.,You're not a dad. You're not a dad.
So are you ok?,I can't believe you got us into trouble.
"Come here. I'll make you feel like one of the guys. You know for a really cool guy, you suck at foosball.","Yeah, just, I feel like I'm about a hundred. I thought I was just one of the guys."
"Yeah, well they suck too.","What're you talkin' about, I was killin' 'em."
"Ok, and then you take the poopie diaper and you put it in the poopie diaper pail.",
Hello.,"Ok Ross, just so you know, calling it a poopie diaper doesn't make this process any cuter."
Come on up. I'm gonna get the rest of his stuff together.,It's us.
Hi.,"Ok, we can do this now, can't we Ben? Yes we can, yes we can. There. I did it. I did it. Look at that, oh, stays on and everything. Hi."
"Wha, what?","I'm sorry, what did you just say? Did you just say hi? Oh my God, Ross, Ross, Ben just said 'Hi'."
"What, the word hi?",Ben just said hi.
"Great, great, and I miss that too, I miss everything.","Ye-, no, my Uncle Hi."
Hello.,"Oh, I'm sorry, I guess I just bring it out in him."
What did he say?,Guess what. Ben just said his first word.
That's so exciting.,Something about hi.
"You know, actually it's more like, hi.",Mommy is so proud of you. Hi. Hi.
Hi.,Hi.
Hi.,Hi.
Hi.,Hi.
"Ok, this could go on for a while.",Hi.
"Well, this was fun. Uh, we should really do it again sometime, wha'dya say? Ok. Alright so I've got him.",We've got a cab waiting downstairs.
"Tuesday right. Ok, bye you guys.",Tuesday.
Bye Ben.,Take care.
"Did, did he just, did he, did he just say, he said bye. He said bye. You said, you said bye to me. You said bye to me.",Bye.
"We've gotta go, we've got that cab waiting.",Suddenly I'm seeing him go off to college.
Bye.,"Alright, alright, ok. Bye."
Bye.,Bye.
Bye.,Bye.
,Bye.
"Ok, Ben, this is the part where Ernie buries Bert in the sand and can't find him. Now, I've looked ahead on the tape and he does find him again. But, ok, before that happens, there's some pretty rough goin' for a while but I think we can handle it. And, there's just the alphabet but we know that ends well so. Ok, here we go.","Oh wow, look at this nice deep hole I've been digging. Hey Bert, isn't this a nice hole here. Hey."
"Oh, I'm so glad you're here.","Bert, Bert. Bert. Hey, what happened to my friend Bert? He was here just a moment ago. Oh no, my old friend Bert is lost."
"Hey Monica, why are we watchin' the business channel?",
"Ok honey, you really need a job.","'Cause I was going by it the other day and I saw that there was a stock with my initials, MEG, on it and, well, sometimes I have to watch for two or three hours before it comes up again but when it does, it's pretty exciting."
Really.,"Mon, speaking of which, dad says he knows someone you can call for an interview."
"On behalf of everyone, I'd just like to say behuh.","Ok, right there. That, that's the third sign today. Right there."
Ahh.,"No, 'cause you just said dad and everywhere I go today I keep getting signs telling me to go see my father. Like when I was walking over here and I passed a buffet...which is my father's last name."
His indian name?,And they were serving franks which is his first name minus the s at the end. And there was a rotisserie with spinning chicken.
Freakish.,No because I chickened out the last time when I tried to meet him. So I mean coincidences? I don't think so.
Freaky.,Wow.
"Ok, so uh, who wants the last hamburger?","Weird, weird."
Why?,"Oh, alright, that's it, now I have to go see him."
,"Hamburger. McDonald's. Old MacDonald had a farm, my dad is a pharmacist."
Oh yeah.,"Man, I am so beat."
Yeah alright.,"Hey, you just wanna forget about raquetball and hang out here?"
"Oh, sorry we didn't know.",Hey you're in our seats.
"Ok, there is one more way to say it, who knows it?","Hey, we were sitting there."
"No actually, I was just going for colorful.",Is that supposed to be funny?
What's with you?,What's with this guy?
What just happened?,"Uh, nothing, nothing's with him. Enjoy your coffee."
"That, that is funny. Can I have it back?","I just took your hat. See, I can be funny too. My, my joke is that I, I took your hat."
No?,No.
"Ok, ok, you know what? I think you're very funny. Kudos on that hat joke. But, come on guy just, just give him back the hat.",No.
"Because it's a special hat. See he bought it 'cause he was feeling really down one day so he got the hat to cheer himself up, ya know. Now Chandler...",Why should we?
You got a problem with that?,"Stop talking, stop talking now. Let me just get this straight. You're actually stealing my hat?"
,"No, just wanna make sure we're on the same page."
It bit. It was a 50's theme restraunt. I have to cook in a costume and dance on the counter. I mean I was a chef at Cafe des Artistes. I mean how could I take a job where I have to make something called Laverne and Curly Fries?,"Hey, how'd the interview go?"
How can I not do it? I have $127 in the bank.,So don't do it.
I don't want a beer.,"Monica, relax, go get a beer."
Hhhiiii.,Who said it was for you?
The mean guys at the coffee house took my hat.,What's the matter with you?
You're kiddin'.,Noo.
Oohhh.,"It was ridiculous. Ya know, these guys, they were bullies, actual bullies, ya know. We're grown ups, this kinda stuff isn't supposed to happen anymore."
Hi.,Hi.
"Hey, woah, let's go down there and get your hat back.","Ohhh Oh no, wait a minute, I have no one."
"Hey, I went up.","Na, forget it, it's probably stripped and sold for parts by now."
"My stock, MEG, it went up 2 points. Hey guys, do you realize that if I had invested my $127 in myself yesterday that I'd like have...a lot more than that today. Ya know what, I'm gonna do it.",What?
Put all my money in me.,Do what?
"What's to know? Buy sell, high low, bears bulls... Yes Manhattan...yeah telephone number of the stock...selling store.","Monica, what are you talking about? You don't know the first thing about the stock market."
,
"Oh God, here we go. For the first time in my life I'm gonna say 'Hi birthfather'.","See, didn't I tell ya these pillows would be a good idea?"
"Yeah good luck, good luck.","We love you, we're here for you."
"Hey Rach, you uh, you want some sandwich?",Thanks.
"Olive loaf and ham spread, no mayo.","Ohh, what is in that?"
"Hey, hey, no, oh oh.","No no, 'cause mayo, that would make it gross."
"No no no, doggie please. Oh, I do so wanna love all animals, please no.",Run Phoebe run.
Are you kidding me?,"Get him a bone, get a bone. You gotta bone?"
Well why don't you just reach out and take his trampoline.,"Look kibbles, bits. Oh God, alright, get the hell off my leg you yippity piece of crap. Ok, alright, we have a problem."
"Hey, hey, hey no.","Ok, here, I know what we can do."
"Well if he's not gonna eat it, I will.","Ok, doggie get the- aahhh. Ok go get the sandwich, get the sandwich doggie. Good doggie get the sandwich, get the...ok, Joey, the dog will lick himself but he will not touch your sandwich, what does that say?"
"Phoebs, he's just a little dog. Ahhh.",Are you crazy?
Hey.,
Do you have to be a Century 21 real-estate agent to get to wear those really cool jackets?,What?
"Hehehehey, isn't that the guy who used to wear your hat?",Do you say this stuff to girls?
"You're joking, right? You guys just walked through the door.",And look where they're sitting.
Yeah.,Maybe we didn't make it clear enough.
"Alright, I'll tell you what, you call the couch and then, and then we'll call the couch, and we'll see who it comes to.",This couch belongs to us.
"Alright, that's it. I've had enough of this, alright. Gunther, these guys are trying to take our seat.",You know what I keep wondering? Why you two are still sitting here.
"Oh, sorry, I didn't realize.","Fellas, these guys were here first."
There you go.,Sorry.
He told on us?,Thank you Gunther. We didn't want to have to go and do that.
"Well pal, you didn't give me much of a choice.",You told on us?
I know.,Don't play with his things.
"Let's, let's take this outside? Who talks like that?","Alright, let's take this outside."
You had to ask.,The guy that's about to kick your ass talks like that.
"Ok, ok look, see, the thing is we're, we're not gonna fight you guys.",Yeah.
I think you played the Gunther card too soon.,"Well then here's the deal, you won't have to so long as never ever show your faces in this coffee house ever again."
"Hey Phoeb's, I think you're good to go.",
What's the matter?,"Yeah, I don't know."
"Yeah Phoebe, I completely understand.","I just think that this was a really bad sign, ya know. I mean, like the beast at the threshold, you know. It's just like, I have no family left, ya know. I mean except for my grandmother, you know, but let's face it, she's not gonna be around forever, despite what she says. And I have a sister who I've barely spoken to since we like shared a womb. I don't know, this is my real father and I just, I want things to be like just right."
"Ok, thanks. Sorry, again","Yeah, whatever you need. Hey, you wanna go home?"
"Uhh, I'm guessing the threshold's clear now.",What was that?
I wanna buy 5 shares of SGJ and I wanna buy them now. C'mon time is money my friend. Thank you. Wooo.,
"Yeah, you missed, 'Takes money to make money,' and uh, 'Don't make me come down there and kick your wall street butt.'",Time is money my friend?
"Well uh, I had breakfast here so technically I saved $3.50.","Hey, I made $17 before breakfast, what have you done?"
"Well, my financially challenged friends, I split my money and I bought some shares of CHP and ZXY.",How did you make $17.
"Well, CHP because I used to have a crush on Eric Estrada. And ZXY becuase I think it sounds zexy.",How come those?
"MEG was good for me but I dumped her. Ya know, my motto is get out before they go down.","What happened to uh, MEG.?"
Hey.,That is so not my motto.
"Ok, I talked to the vet, people are so nice upstate. Anyway, he said that the little fella's gonna be ok and I can pick him up tomorrow.","Hey Phoebs. Oh hey, how's the dog?"
"Oh, thank God.",Good.
"Ok, so Phoebe, now are you gonna call your dad and let him know that his dog is ok?","Yeah, but he did have to have a bunch of stitches and he said that only once in a blue moon does a dog's ear grow back so...still hoping."
"Hey Phoebs, if you want, I'll do it.","I, I don't wanna meet my father over the phone. What am I gonna say, like 'Hi, I'm Phoebe, the daughter you abandoned. Oh, by the way, I broke your dog.'"
DON'T...be too long with the phone.,"Ok. Listen, just don't say anything about me, ok."
It's a woman.,She'll be a much better friend when the market closes.
"Uhh, hello Miss Buffay. I know where your dog is. I want you to know that he'll be returned to you, almost as good as new, within, within 24 hours. Uh, goodbye.",So talk to her.
Hard to say.,Why the voice.
Your cappucino sir.,
Ya know I think this is much better than the coffee house.,Thank you.
How come it's not mixing with the water?,Absolutely.
"Hey, this is ridiculous. I'll tell you what. After I get back from my neice's christening, I'll go down to the coffee house with you and we'll all have a nice cup of coffee alright. No problem, Joey's there.","Well the package says you have to uh, constantly keep it moving. Stir and drink, stir and drink, never let it settle."
No.,Ok.
"No. Man I don't wanna have to have Joey with me every time I wanna descent cup of coffee. Ya know, and I don't wanna spend the rest of my life drinking cappucino with a 'K'. I say you and I go back down there and stand up to those guys.",No?
"Yeah really, Ross, have you ever been beaten up before?","Alright, hang on a second there Custer."
By someone besides Monica?,"Yeah, sure."
"Well, couldn't we just lose our virginities again? Ya know, because I think actually mine's growing back.","No. So what. So what if we get beaten up, maybe that's just something every man has to go through once in his life. Ya know, like a, like a right of passage or somethin'."
I need to borrow a hundred bucks.,
"Hi, welcome home. I need to borrow a hundred bucks.",What?
I've gotta get back in the game.,For what?
"I don't know, I lost it all ok. I lost it.","Why, when did you get out of the game?"
"Hey, I've come to terms with it, you have to too.",Oh no.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, where are we on the hundred bucks?","Ok. Look uhh, Mon I'm, I'm really sorry."
"But I need it. Otherwords I'm gonna have to take that horrible diner job. You know, with the dancing and the costumes. I don't wanna have to wear flame retardant boobs.","I, I don't have it."
,Nobody does honey.
"Schnoodle. Oh my God, what the hell happened to my dog?",Hi.
"What are these, stitches?","It was an accident, and, and the woman who did this would never ever hurt a dog on purpose. She's a vegetarian."
"Yeah well, thanks for bringing back what's left of him.","Yeah, eight of them. That's 56 to him. You know also, if, if it's raining, you can't let him look up too long 'cause that cone'll fill up really really fast."
How do you know Frank?,"Sure, oh, is, is Frank home."
Yeah. Frank.,"Just from a, from a long time ago. Is he here?"
"Oh, ok, um, I mean Frank senior.",Yeah. What?
Ok so will he be back soon?,He went out for groceries.
"Alright, I'm, I'm gonna go. I'm sorry about the dog, everything. I'm sorry.",Well he left four years ago so we're expecting him back any minute now.
Um well I don't really. Just genetically. He's kinda my dad too.,Hey lady. Hey wait up. How do you know my dad?
"Yeah. So um, did he ever talk about me, Phoebe?",Heavy.
Oh.,No but he didn't really talk about anything.
Stilts?,Except stilts.
Wow.,"Yeah, he loved stilts. One time I was upstairs, I was stealing cigarettes out of my mom's purse, and uh, all of a sudden I look over and there's my dad's head bobbing past the window. He just had this big smile on his face and he was waving 'cause he was always happiest when he was on his stilts."
I don't know what to do with that.,Yeah.
Yeah.,Me neither. So you're like my big sister.
"I'm not gonna. But you know what's cool though? Ok, if you had a friend named Pete, then I could say, 'Oh yeah, I know Pete, he's friends with my brother.'","This is huge, you can buy me beer."
That'll work too.,I gotta friend named Mark.
"Yeah, that'd be ok.","Cool, alright. So maybe, ya know, I could give you a call sometime, we could talk or somethin'."
"Ok, I'm in the book.",Alright.
"Alright. So um, stilts huh?","Ok, yeah."
Ok.,"Yeah hey, you know if you want I can take you around back and show you where he hit his head on the rain gutter."
"Well we did it, we're here. We are standing our ground. How long does a cup of coffee take?",
"Ah, there we go.",Would you come on! Come on! Thank you.
You burn your mouth?,I think we proved our point.
"Bullies, big bullies.",Cannot feel my tounge.
Did we not make ourselves clear the other day.,"Oh, look who's here, it's the weenies."
"Yes, we're standing out ground...apparently.","Yes, and that's why we're here."
"Woah, ho-ho, whad'ya got there, a weapon?",Let's do this alright.
"Alright, let's do this.","It's a nice watch, I don't wanna break it on your ribs."
"Question. If I don't care about my watch, can I use it as a weapon?",Alright.
"Well, it's sharp, it's metal, I think I can do some, you know, serious damage with it.",Whad'ya mean?
Ok.,"No, you can't use your watch."
Ok.,Or your keys.
"Before I forget, are we hitting faces?","Look, here's what we'll do. We'll put all keys and watches in the hat over there. Alright. Alright, c'mon man, let's do this."
"Well because I have to work on Monday, I have a big presentation.","Of course we're hitting faces, why wouldn't you hit faces?"
"Ok, nothing from the neck up. Or the waist down. Dana's ovulating.","Actually, you know, uh, I gotta show this apartment tomorrow and uh, you know, this no faces thing might not be a bad idea."
Yeah.,"Oh really, you guys tryin' again?"
C'MON!,"Ok, so let me just get this straight. So we're uh, strictly talking about the middle?"
"Hey, hey, those guys are takin our stuff!","Hey, hey, woah, you want some of this, huh? You want a piece of this, huh? I'm standin here, huh."
Hey.,Hey.
"God, that was, that was amazing, that was incredible. You guys, you guys kicked butt.",
Yeah he was wasn't he.,"Us, what about you guys? Man you really, bing, gave it to old Mr. Clean back there. He was a big guy."
Don't do that to yourself. Any one of us could have tripped over that little girls jump-rope.,"Yeah, I wouldn't know having missed everything."
We're ok.,"So, listen guys, are we uh, are we ok here?"
"Ok so, can I have my hat back?",Alright.
Huh.,No.
Look at her.,
"He-he-he, how's it goin'?",Hi Monica.
"Guys guys, check this out.",Hey nice boobs.
,Excellent.
Ohhh.,"So, I'll get candles and my mom's lace tablecloth, and since it's Rachel's birthday, I mean, we want it to be special, I thought I'd poach a salmon."
Question. Why do we always have to have parties where you poach things?,What?
Question two. Why do we always have to have parties with committees?,You wanna be in charge of the food committee?
Yeah.,Really. Why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun?
"Alright. If you guys don't want it to be special, fine. You can throw any kind of party you want.","Yeah, I agree. Ya know, I think fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside and I'm just not sure we are."
"Wow, it's, it's like porno for clowns.","Joey they're not real. I start miles beneath the surface of these things, ok, they're fake. See honk honk."
"I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come.",
"Woah, woah, woah, uh, no Shannon Cooper.","Ok, um so, I still have to invite Dillon and Emma and Shannon Cooper."
"Cause she uh, she steals stuff.",Why not her?
Joey that is horriable.,Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called her back.
"I'm sorry, I didn't know.","Hey I liked her, alright. Maybe, maybe too much. I don't know I guess I just got scared."
"Hi honey, how did it go?","I didn't think anyone'd buy that, ok."
"Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.","Agh, it was the graduation from hell."
So what happened?,"Ya know, I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion. My sister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would. It's a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a Celica."
"Ok, so I guess we don't invite her parents.","My parents happened. All they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile proudly, and not talk about the divorce. But nooo, they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address. Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them. But you know what, you know what the good news is? I get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours."
Why her mom?,"Well, how bout just her mom?"
"Ooh, ooh, did you ask Stacy Roth?",Cause I already invited her.
,"Oh no, can't invite her. She also steals."
"Ok, we're not having birthday cake, we're having birthday flan.","Ok, here are the birthday candles. Where's the birthday cake?"
It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert.,Excuse me?
Dr. Greene. Oh my God it's Rachel's dad. What're you doing here?,"Oh that's nice. Happy birthday Rachel, here's some goo."
"No no, the father can, but um, since I am the roommate I can tell you that she's not here and I'll pass along the message, ok. So bye-bye.",What? The father can't drop by to see the daughter on her birthday?
"No, no, not a party. Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows. Um, this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey.","Ohhh, you're having a parteee."
"This isn't your first surprise party, is it sir?","I'll never remember all of that. So uh, what's the deal? Rachel comes home, people pop out and yell stuff, is that it?"
Chinese menu guy. Forgot the menus.,Hi Monica.
"Uh, hey, Dr. Greene, why don't you come with me, we'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed.","So, basically just a Chinese guy."
"Well, my goodness, what was that?","Alright, that sounds like a two person job."
You thought I was Rachel?,"Sandra, I am so sorry, I thought you were Rachel and we just weren't ready for you yet."
"And because you're both, you know, white women.","Yes because uh, you look so young."
"NO! No, I'll take that for ya.","Oh, I missed you kids. Well, should I put my coat in the bedroom?"
"Ha-ha, that's great, ha-ha. I can't wait to hear the rest of it, ya know, but I really have to go to the bathroom so... Hey, come with me. Yeah, yeah, it'll be like we're gal pals, ya know, like at a restraunt. Oh, it'll be fun, c'mon.","Oh well thank you. Such a gentleman. Thank you. Ahh, it all looks so nice, so festive, all the balloons... The funniest thing happened to me on the way here. I was..."
"Ok, think, what would Jack and Chrissy do?","Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God."
"So uh, Joey and Chanlder, I, I think it's time that you take Dr. Greene over to your place.","Ok, now that your coat is safely in the bedr-, oh, ok we can come back out in the living room."
Because that's where the party is you goon. See this is just the staging area.,"Uhh, yes, absdolutely, um. Why again?"
"Yeah, this more than anything else, is the staging area.",Right this is staging.
,This is clearly in the wrong apartment.
Chandler could you at least send some women to my party? Alright that's Ross.,"Alright you guys are off to party number one and you, you are off to party number two Alright fellas, let's keep it movin', let' keep it movin."
"Ohh, thank you for the wonderful dinner.","Ok, they're coming, shhh."
"Ohh, thank you for my beautiul earrings, they're perfect. I love you.",Thanks for being born.
Now I love you even more.,"Oh, now you can exchange them if you want, ok."
"Oh my gosh, wow. Monica. Oh my god. Mom. This is so great.",Surprise.
"Wow you, you. I had no idea.",Happy birthday sweetie.
"No, I knew.",Really?
"Ok, everybody, there's food and drinks on the table. Go across the hall.",All right.
What?,What?
Why.,"Right now, Joey and Chandler's, go now."
Surprise.,Just go.
Daddy.,Happy birthday sweetpea.
"Well, we could count again.","Both of them are here, both of them, both of them are here?"
"You know what, this is ridiculous, ok. This is your birthday, this is your party. I say we just put 'em all together and if they can't deal with it, who cares.",I can't believe this is happening.
That's who.,I do.
"Well, I have to be, I don't really have a choice, I mean, you know, I could look at the bright side, I get two birthday parties and two birthday cakes.","Look, are you gonna be ok?"
What?,"Well, actually just one birthday flan."
,"It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert...Look talk to Monica, she's on the food committee."
Quick volleyball question.,"Joey, Joey. Hey, some girl just walked up to me and said, 'I want you Dennis,' and stuck her tounge down my throat. I love this party."
"Yeah, we set up a court in your room. Uh, you didn't really like that grey lamp, did you?",Volleyball.
Dennis.,"Joey, a woman just stuck her tounge down my throat, I'm not even listening to you."
"Listen honey, can you keep dad occupied, I'm gonna go talk to mom for a while.","Ok, that's me."
"Uhh, let's just stay clear of 'I'm the guy that's doing you daughter' and you should be ok.","Ok, do you have any ideas for any openers?"
"Hi Dr. Greene. So, uh, how's everything in the uh, vascular surgery....game?","Ok people, I want you to take a piece of paper, here you go, and write down your most embarassing memory. Oh, and I do ask that when you're not using the markers, you put the caps back on them because they will dry out."
I'm sorry. See that's the good thing about my job. All the dinosaurs on my table are already dead.,"It's not a game Ross, a woman died on my table today."
"I um, was sorta thinking about maybe...","Listen you guys, I don't mean to be a pain about this but, um, I've noticed that some of you are just placing them on. You wanna push the caps until you hear them click. Gunther, where're you going?"
"Listen if you wanna go, just go.","No. No you can't go. No this is fun. Come on we're just getting started. Here, here's your marker."
"Alright, I can get you out.","No, she'll yell at me again."
"Shh. In a minute, I'm gonna create a diversion. When I do, walk quickly to the door and don't look back.",What?
"Oh, here, I, I'll get it for ya. Whad'ya want?",I think I need a drink.
"Scotch. Alright, I'll be back in 10 seconds with your scotch on the rocks in a glass.",Scotch.
Cool.,Neat.
I know.,"No no no, no no no, neat, as in no rocks."
"Hi. Uh, I have been in the bathroom. Stay clear of the salmon mousse.","Oh hello Ross, where have you been?"
"Oh, mine too. Isn't that neat, scotch neat. Would you excuse me? Hey, hey, where you uh, sneakin off to mister?","Oh, scotch neat. Ya know, that's Rachel's father's drink."
No. no.,I'm getting my cigarettes out of my jacket.
"No, um, see 'cause that, that is, that is the staging area. If you go in there, it'll ruin the whole illusion of the party. Yeah, I think you take your scotch back in there and I will get your cigarettes for you sir.",Whad'ya mean no?
All righty roo. What a great moment to say that for the first time.,Get my glasses too.
"Oh no, ooh, ooh, did somebody forget to use a coaster?","Ok, the first person's most embarassing memory is, 'Monica, your party sucks.' Very funny."
"Great, I'm seeing water rings again.",What? I don't see anything.
Mine.,"Ross, whose glasses are those?"
"Um-hmm. I have a condition, apparently, that I require two different sets of focals.",You wear bi-focals?
Well those are very popular frames.,Did you know my husband has glasses just like that?
I hear you can get people out of here.,Neil Sedaka wears them.
"Yeah, like a chimney.","Rachel, you didn't tell me your boyfriend smoked."
Are you wearing my glasses?,"Ohh, big smoker. Big big smoker. In fact I'm gonna go ou into the hallway and fire up this bad boy."
Thank you. Is that one of my cigarettes?,Yes. I was just warming up the earpieces for you.
"Ok, ok, she's taking the trash out so I can get you out of here but it has to be now, she'll be back any minute.","Yeah, yes it is, I was just moistening the tip."
"No, only the three of you, any more than that and she'll get suspicious.",What about my friend Victor?
There isn't time. You must leave everything. They'll take care of you next door.,"Alright, let me just get my coat."
Everything you've heard is true.,Is it true they have beer?
"You, and you, you're supposed to be at my party. And Gunther! What are you doing here?","Could you guys please try to keep it down, we're trying to start a Boggle tournament."
"Ok, welcome to the fu-oh.",Um
"Alright, I'm sorry but these people needed me. They work hard all week, it's Saturday night, they deserve to have a little fun. Go.",Phoebe.
You want me to see a therapist?,"Ya know, my party is fun. I mean, maybe it's a little quieter, less obvious sorta fun but, you know, if people would just give it a chance..."
"Ok mom, you know what, fine, I'll make an appointment ok, but you know what, right now, I gotta go, I gotta go do a thing.","Sweetheart, you obviously have a problem. You've chosen a boyfriend exactly like your father."
"Daddy, daddy, you know what, I really wanna hear more about this, I really do, but I just have, I just have to do a, some stuff.",Did you know your mother spent $1200 dollars on bansai trees. I felt like Gulliver around that place.
You work and you work and you work on a boat...,You work and you work and you work at a marriage but all he cares about is his stupid boat.
...and you sand it and you varnish it...,He always ridiculed my pottery classs...
...and her yoga and her Bridges of Madison County...,"...but when all is said and done, he still drinks out of the mugs."
...and the bansai's and the chiuaua...,...the scotch and the cigarettes...
...what the hell does she want with half a boat...,...I may have only been in therapy for three weeks now dear but...
"Ok, ok, you can be shirts and I'll be skins. I'll be skins. Hey, how you holdin' up there, tiger? Oh, sorry, when my parents were getting divorced I got a lot of tigers. Got a lot of champs, chiefs, sports, I even got a governor.",
"Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed.","This is it, isn't it? I mean, this is what my life is gonna be like. My mom there, my dad there. Thanksgiving, Christmas. She gets the house, he's in some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker. Oh, Chandler how did you get through this?"
Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?,"Ya know, I just, so weird. I mean I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July."
"I, I know.","It's just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks. Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket. It never occured to anybody to bring another one. And now it's just..."
"Ok, thanks for coming, I hope you guys had fun.",
Ok will do. So glad you came.,"Alright, Monica dear, I'm gonna hit the road. Now I've left my 10 verbs on the table. And you be sure and send me that finished poem."
"Ok, let me go check. Your mom want's to say goodbye.",I think I saw Rachel out in the hall.
Happy birthday sweetie.,Oh ok.
"Ahh, you drive safe.",Ok.
I'm getting ready for the water skiing. How are you doing?,"Ross, what're you doing."
To get my coat.,"Well, uh, Dr. Greene, where are you going?"
"Alright, alright, I can get my own coat.",No no no.
"Oh no, you're not supposed to be here. This is the staging area, you should, it's all wrong, you should leave, ya know, get out. Or perhaps you'd like a creme d'menthe.","Sorry, we're on a major flan high."
"Oh all right, then I guess we're going back into the hallway.","I have to be heading to my chateau, thank you."
"Oh, you kids Well, this is the best party I've been to in years.","Thanks for coming Mrs. Greene. Well, ok, you take care."
,Thank you.
"Yup, get ready for the gelatenous fun.","Ok everybody, it's time for flan."
"Ok, that's enough.",Kinda looks like that stuff you get when you get a bad infection.
"Ok, I've got one. Wow, those things almost never come true.","Ok Rachel, make a special flan wish."
,
"Oh, I ordered mine first.","Ok, Chandler, Mon, there's only one bananna nut muffin left."
Give it to me.,"Yeah, but I'm, I'm so much faster..."
Give it to me.,No.
"There you go, enjoy your coffee.","Ok, you can have it."
"Hey you guys, you will never guess who's coming to New York.",That was there when I got here.
"Oh ok, Ryan, that guy I went out with, who's in the Navy.","Quick, Phoebe, tell us before he can swallow."
"Yeah, I met him when I was playing guitar in Washington Square Park. Ryan threw in salt water taffy 'cause he didn't have any change.",You went out with a guy in the Navy?
"No. No, he is my submaring guy. He resurfaces like every couple years and we have the most amazing three days together. Only this time he's coming for two weeks. Two whole weeks, which means yay.","Hey, is that when you wrote salt water taffy man?"
That'll teach you to lick my muffin.,"So wait, this guy goes down for like two years at a time?"
"Oh no, what happened?",Hiii.
Oh no.,"Well, I just spoke to Carol. Ben's got the chicken pox."
Well I've had it.,"Yeah, so if you haven't already had it, chances are you're gonna get it."
Had it.,"Yeah, I've had it."
"Well, I've never had it, I feel so left out. Oh look!",Had it.
"Honey, you made the bed again. I told you, you don't have to do that. This isn't camp.",
"Monica... Hey Mon, I have a question. Is Leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town or the fattest man in the whole damn town?","Ooh, then I guess the panty raid last night was totally uncalled for. Ok, I am going to take a shower and today I will be singing Jim Crochee's Leroy Brown."
What're you doing?,Baddest. Otherwise the song would be Fat Fat Leroy Brown.
Are you remaking the bed?,Just waiting for you sweetie.
"Then, you're redoing it because...","I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what, the way you did it was just fine."
You're pretty much running that risk either way.,"If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy."
"Oh, well that's not so crazy.","Ok, you see, the tag shouldn't be at the top left corner, it should be at the bottom right corner."
"Oh, alright.",I'm just easing you in.
"Actually, if it's possible, I love you more.","Alright, you see these little flower blossoms? They should be facing up, not down, because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be. You don't love me any more do you."
,"Really? Wow, well then come on, I wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point."
But don't you need experience for a job like that?,"Hey, look Joey, I'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can get you a job right here as an entry level processor."
"Hey Chandler, here's this morning's projections.","It's not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing, hey, you're an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor."
No kidding.,"Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni. Joey is a uh, fellow processor."
Where do you work?,"Oh yeah yeah. I process. People want the processing, I'm the one they call."
I was just telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group.,"Uhh, well, right now I'm in between things. You know how it is. One day you're processing, the next day you're not so much... processing any more."
Ha-ha. Are all you processors dorks?,"Fleischman's group. Whatever you do, don't touch his sandwiches. Ha-ha-ha..."
"Oh, this lipstick looks just great on you.",
"Yeah? Are you sure, really.","You look fabulous honey, you really do."
"I, I, I'm hideous.","You see, you look beautiful. For god sakes, dim the lights."
,It's gonna be ok. Ryan's been under water. He's just gonna be so glad that you don't have barnicles on your butt.
"Hey baby, I'm back...",Come in.
What's goin' on?,"Hey Ryan, what's up?"
Chicken or small?,"Well, no no, you have to stay back. I, I have the pox."
Why aren't you at home in bed?,Chicken. Which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian.
"I'm sorry, I never had 'em.","'Cause my, my grandmother's never had chicken pox. Please, please tell me you have, 'cause oh my God, I forgot how cute you are."
"If I had one wish, it would be to build a time machine, go back to when I was 7, when Jimmy Hauser had the chicken pox. I would grab that kid and rub him all over my face.","Ohh, ohh."
Can I please see your face?,"Yeah, or you know, you could just wish that I didn't have them now."
"Your face could be covered with lochs, I wouldn't care.",Nope. You don't want to see a face covered with pox.
"Sorry, the lightning. Lightning was an unfortunate incidence. You look lovely, lovely.","And you hate fish. Oh. That's so sweet, alright. Ok, alright, you can see. This is me... Oh, I am scary."
"Phoebe, I have spent the last eight months in a steel tube with men, thinking about this moment. I am not gonna let a bunch of itchy spots stand between us.","I hate this. 'Cause I tell you, I had the most amazing two weeks planned for us, and almost everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this."
,"Ok, this is the most romantic disease I've ever had."
"Hey, how's the first day goin'?",Hey.
Well there you go.,Pretty good. It's like you said. It's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column.
"Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?","Hey and everbody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie."
Weird world. Your kids?,"Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh?"
Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.,I figure my character has kids.
"Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.","Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does."
Really? Wow. That's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.,"Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid... Ya know what? Just did."
You know what makes the itching even worse?,
Fine.,That you don't stop talking about it.
What're you doing? Are you scratching?,"Let's just play, ok. Good, ok. Here we go, double sixes, here we go... Here we go, come to mama, just getting ready to roll the dice..."
You're scratching. Give me the dice.,"No. This is what I do for luck, ok."
Give me the dice.,No.
"We can't scratch. You know we can't, we'll scar.","No. Here. There. Ooh, double sixes."
No.,"Uhh, I can't stop thinking about it. It's just so hard. I just wanna grab all these houses and rub 'em all over my body."
No.,Give it.
Oh God help me.,"Yeah, come on. You know you want it, you know you want it too, come on. Let's just be bad, it'll feel so good."
"Oh, stop that, stop that right now.","Now do me, do my back. Oh come on, harder."
,"You know, I might have expected this of you Phoebe, but Ryan, you're a military man."
"Oh, that sounds lovely. We're gonna have to set that up. Oh, I better get back. Hope the baby feels better.","You and Milton have to join us on the boat. Karen'll pack a lunch, you'll bring the kids, we'll make a day of it."
Bye bye Joey.,"Oh, thanks, thanks. Bye bye Jeannie."
"Well, I'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing. Hey Mr. Douglas.",What a phony.
"Uh, listen Bing, I received your memo. So, we're not gonna receive the systems report until next Friday?",Sir.
"I have a family, I'm gonna be here.",Well the people in my group wanna spend the holiday weekend with their families.
"It's about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale. Look, if you wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday.","Yeah Bing, what's that about?"
This company was not built on rough numbers. Am I right Mr. Douglas.,Rough numbers?
"Uh, if you say so sir.",Have the final numbers on my desk by Tuesday.
"Well, I'm going to kill you.","Joseph's good, isn't he?"
Why?,"Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. Ya know, get in there, ruffle some feathers."
,"Look, I'm sorry but that's what Joseph does, ok. If you try to pull somethin', he'll call you on it. 'What're you tryin' to pull,' he'll say."
This is for the scratchy twins out there. I taped oven mits to their hands.,"Ooh, duct tape. Was I supposed to bring something too?"
It's for their own good.,You're strict.
"Exactly. Oh, I love that I can be totally neurotic around you now. Tell me the truth. Don't you like it better now that everything on your desk is perpendicular?","You know, I like the way you have efficiently folded this tab under. See in a tape emergency you could shave valuable seconds off your time."
Very good.,"If it's not a right angle, it is a wrong angle."
You know what. Tomorrow I'm gonna do your clocks.,Thank you.
I'm gonna set them to my time.,You're gonna do what to my clocks.
"No no. See, in my bedroom I set my clock six minutes fast. You wanna know why?","Well, I'm confused. I thought we shared time."
"No forget it, I'm not gonna tell you now.",Because it's in a slightly different time zone than the kitchen.
No. See you don't understand.,No come on. Come on tell me.
No. You don't have any of these cute little obsessive things.,Come on.
Oh yeah.,No that's not true. That is not true.
"Alright, well tell me one of yours.",Yeah.
What if they get mixed up?,"Ok. Ahh. One of my things is, I always separate my sweat socks from my dress socks."
"You would not. I can't believe this. I hate this, you're too normal. I can't believe my boyfriend doesn't have a thing. My boyfriend doesn't have a thing.","Boy I would just uh, I would freak out."
,"See, if anyone overheard that, I didn't come off well."
Why? Wh- wh- why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?,Hey. Mr. Douglas is looking for you.
"Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?",'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project.
"Alright, that's it. Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not possible so I'm gonna have to let both of you go.","Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know."
"I don't, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he's a brown-nosing suck up.","What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph."
"Alright, ok, alright. So I can't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife.","Oh yeah. Well you can't fire Joseph. You know why, 'cause he's not in your department."
"Yeah, Karen. I'm thinking about having an affair with her. Oh, you know what? I just did.",Karen.
"Oh well it's not me, it's my character, Chandy. Yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co-worker's wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler. In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer.",Ahh. What the hell are you doing to me man.
"No freakshow, she's fictional.",Really?
Thank you.,"Take it easy. If it means that much to you, I'll uh, I'll go find something else."
,"It's just that, I, I'm gonna miss Joseph. I liked him. His wife, she was hot."
"No sorry hon, Monica's orders.",Can I please take these off? I swear I won't scratch.
"Ok, dinner's on.",Well that wasn't easy.
"Alright you kids, bye now.",And there's a peach cobbler warming in the oven so the plate's gonna be hot but that shouldn't be a problem for you.
"Oh look, a low budget puppet show.",Bye.
Wine?,It's such a shame you can't see which finger I'm holding up.
"Oh, I spilled some.",Please.
"I must tell you, you look beautiful tonight.",I got it.
Sorry. You look beautiful.,What?
"You know what, that's it, that's it.",Oh.
"Monica, wake up. Monica.",
I thought of a thing.,What's up?
"Yeah. I have to sleep, have to, on this side of the bed.",Yeah?
Or so I would have you believe.,No honey. You have to sleep on this side of the bed because I have to sleep on this side of the bed.
"Hey come on, you haven't heard my reason yet.","No. Big deal, so you have a side of the bed, everybody has a side of the bed."
"Ok, I have to sleep on the west side because I grew up in California and otherwise the ocean would be on the wrong side.","Alright, go on."
Yeah. How 'bout that.,"Oh my God, you're a freak."
"So uh, Ryan, were you shipping off to?",
So do you have like any nuclear weapons on board?,I really can't say.
"Well do you get to look through one of those like, those periscope thingys.",I can't say.
"Wow, it, it's neat learning about submarines.","I'm sorry, but I can't say."
"Ok, I'll walk you out.","I better get out of here, I'm gonna miss my flight."
Pleasure.,Bye Ryan.
Take care.,It was nice to meet you.
You like that do ya?,"So do you uh, think we can get you one of those uh, uniform things?"
I'll make some calls.,Oh yeah.
Can you believe how we spent our two weeks together?,Ok.
Taxi.,"I know. We didn't do any of the romantic things I had planned, like having a picnic at Central Park and ya know, coffee at Central Perk. Oh I just got that."
,Bye you.
Is this what you had in mind?,"Oh I'm sorry, we're clo-... Hey sailor."
I'm shipping out tomorrow.,I'll say.
"Alright you know, why don't I just meet you upstairs.","Well then uh, we better make this night count. Oh wait, I forgot to turn off the cappucino machine. Anchors away. Oh no no, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my pu rse. Oh, you know what. I forgot to turn off the bathroom light."
"Hey Joey, how'd the audition go?",
Who?,Incredible! I met the director this time and you'll never believe who it was.
Wow!,All right. I'll give you one hint. Warren Beatty.
'Cause he was just so darn cute.,"Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem. See, I, uh, had to kiss this guy."
"Well, hey. You're an actor, I say you just suck it up and do it. Or you just do it.","No, as part of the audition. See, I'm up for this part of this guy, who the main guy kisses."
Then what's the problem?,"I did do it, I'm a professional."
"Well, come on, who cares what that guy thinks. What does Warren Beatty know about kissing Ooh.","See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says 'good actor, bad kisser'. Can you believe that, me not a good kisser, that's like, like Mother Theresa, not a good mother."
"Hey, what did your agent say?",
"What, forget it!","Yep, this kiss thing is defiantly a problem, Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on Monday. Man, I gotta figure out what I'm doing wrong. Oh, okay, one of you girls come over here and kiss me."
"Come on, I need your help here.","Yeah, right."
"You see this, this is a friend.","All right. I'll do it, I kissed him before I can do it again."
Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem?,"Uh-huh, let's go. Oh, wait I have gum. Okay. Good, very good, firm but tender. I'd recommend you to a friend."
"Yeah, that makes sense.","Joey, you know, maybe your just not used to kissing men, maybe you just tensed up a little, maybe that's what you need to work on."
And I'll be using his dead body as a shield.,Over my dead body!
"Come on out, honey! I'm telling you look good! Tell her she looks good, tell her she looks good.",
I can not believe I have to walk down the aisle in front of 200 people looking like something you drink when your nauseous.,"Oh my God, you look so good!"
Because I promised Mindy I would.,"So don't, I don't see why we have to go to this thing anyway, it's your ex-fiancee's wedding."
"Look you guys, I have to go, I'm the Maid-of-Honor. And besides you know what I just need to be in a room again with these people and feel good about myself.","Yeah, well you promised Barry, you'd marry him."
I may have.,Ooh-oh! Someone's wearing the same clothes they had on last night. Someone get a little action?
What's she look like?,"Woo-hoo, stuud!"
"Woo-hoo, geeek!","Well, we haven't exactly met, we just stayed up all night talking on the internet."
Get out!,"I like this girl, okay, I seriously like this girl, you now how sometimes I tend get a little defended and quipy..."
Please!,Nooo!
Wow! What's that like?,"Well she totally called me on it, okay. She said, 'cut it out, get real', and I did."
"All right, stop it, you're freaking me out.","It's like this, me, no jokes."
"Bye, Richard.","Oh, yeah, I don't like you this way. All right, I'll see you guys later."
"I love you, too.","Bye sweetie, I love you."
What are you talking about? What wedding?,"I think my boyfriend ever so dreamy, I wonder what our wedding's gonna be like."
"Nooo! Never! I mean, we're living in the moment. God, it is so nice for once to not have to get all hung up on 'Where is this going?'","Come on, like you never talk that."
Could not be more terrified.,Afraid to ask him?
,"Well, I think you should seriously consider the marriage thing, give Rachel another chance to dress up like Princess Bubble Yum."
"Awww! You know that's probably why babies learn to talk, so they can tell grown ups to cut it out.","Where's Benny? There he is! Where's Benny, there he is."
Okay.,"Hey, you know I got a question for ya. Just a little thing, no pressure."
Sure I do.,"Did you ever, uh, like, think about the future?"
"Honey, you are in it.","Yeah, am I in it?"
"Oh, yeah!","Oh God, you are about to get sooo lucky."
"Well, uh, sometimes I think about selling my practice, we could move to France, make French toast.",Keep talkin'.
Like a hound?,"Okay, so, uh, we're in France, we're making the toast. Do you see a little bassinet in the corner?"
You really need the bassinet?,"Not a basset, a bassinet."
"Oh, hey. I love children, I have children. I just don't want to be 70 when our kids go off to college, and our lives can finally start.","Well, I just think the baby would keep falling off the dog. Do you, uh, do you , do you not see kids in our future."
"Look I want you, now.",Uh-huh.
,"That's Great. You know we don't need to talk about this now. Really, I mean this is, is so way, way, way, in the future, I'm talkin' hovercrafts and apes taking over the planet."
"Joey, no means no!","Come on, Chandler, I want this part soo much. Just one kiss, I won't tell anyone."
"I'm sorry we, we don't have your sheep.",Hey!
Get away from me I said no!,"Aww, Rach, I think you look cute And you, uh, you, you I could eat with a spoon ."
"Oh, Richard's here. I should run down say bye to him",Richard buzzed. He's waiting downstairs.
"Bye, good luck.",Bye.
"Oh, it's a website, it's the, uh, the Guggenheim museum. See, she likes art, and I like funny words.","So how's your date with your cyberchick going. Ooh, hey, what is all that ."
It means we're holding hands.,What does she mean by HH?
I'm afraid I might just be.,Are you the cutest?
"Okay, it's not a guy, all right, I know her.","You know, what I think is so great that you are totally into this person and yet for all you know she could be like 90 years old, or have two heads, or. It could be a guy."
"Man, I got this close to him and Monica kneed me in the back. What's going on?",It could be like a big giant guy.
"Oh, well. Just ask her how long she's gonna live. Women live longer than men.",We were just wondering if Chandler's girlfriend is a girl.
"Okay, ask her 'What is her current method of birth control?'",How do you not fall down more?
Well at least we know she's a woman.,"All right. ""My husband is sleeping with his secretary."" She's married!"
"Aw, man I'm sorry . This must be very tough for ya, huh .",I can't believe she's married.
"So, I read this article in the paper the other day that says you're not supposed to throw rice at weddings, because when pigeons eat rice it kills them.",
"Oh, absolutely. Yeah, you know I'm not even thinking about that thing that we're not supposed to think about.","Oh, that's why you never see pigeons at sushi bars. See, we're having fun."
,Neither am I.
Hi.,"Hey, there."
"Yeah, when I was in the bathroom I saw the window that I crawled out of at my wedding, and God, I just started thinking that I shouldn't be here, you know I shouldn't, people are going to be looking at me and judging me and, and thinking about the last time.",Are you all right?
"God I know, you're right.","Sweetie, it's be gonna okay, all right. It's a wedding, generally people focus on the bride."
"Okay, I'll see you after the thing.","All rightie, everybody look at me. Good. All right, its time. Bridesmaids and ushers let's see two lines, thank you."
"Thank you, Okay, Okay.","Okay, good luck"
Why the hell didn't you tell me!,
"Oh my God this is sooo humiliating. I think the only thing that tops that was, was, was when I was in the eight grade and I had to sing the Copa Cabana in front of the entire school. I think I got about two lines into it before I ran and freaked out. Oh my God, my entire life is flashing before my eyes.","I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do stand up and shout 'Hey, Rachel, your butt is showing!'"
"Oh Ross, would you stop, you got me, I'm dating you.","Rach, hey look, I remember that, it wasn't so bad."
"Oh hi, Mr. Wineburg, hi Mrs. Wineburg.",Rachel!
You told me you didn't see anything.,"It's so wonderful to see you again, my dear, in fact I hardly expected to see so much."
"Well it's wonderful to have you up and about, again, dear.",I tell ya a lot things!
"Okay, now that is the third time someone has said something like that to me today.",Stay well.
"Oh, hi!",Rach! Rach!
I know.,"Oh my God, I'm married!"
"Oh honey, I'm so proud of you, Min.",I'm Mrs. Dr. Barry Hunter hyphen Farber.
"Yeah, I love that story. Um, I got a question for you guys. Why do people keep is saying that is good to see me up and about?","Min. Oh Rach, you're still here, at our wedding, they were packing up the chopped liver about now."
Insane!,"Well uh, after you ran out on your wedding, Barry's parents told people that you were sort of....insane."
What?!,...from the syphilis.
,"Yeah, what are they gonna say you didn't love me anymore. Come on."
"Aren't you gonna answer her, that's like the tenth bing-bong message she sent. She wants to know what's wrong?","Angela? Joey Tribiani. Listen, what are ya doing tonight. I know your seeing that guy I was thinking maybe you could bring him.....Hello? Hello?"
"Oh, my.",What's wrong? What's wrong? You're married that's what's wrong.
She wants to meet you in person.,What?
"What if the husband person is the wrong guy, and you are the right guy. I mean you don't get chances like this all the time, if you don't meet her now, you're gonna be kicking yourself when your 80, which is hard to do, and that's how you break a hip.","Hey, look, Phoebe I wanted to meet her in person too, okay, but she's married, she has a husband."
"Oh, yeah! Okay! Great! Go, man, go put on your shoes, and, and march out there and meet her! Oh, wait, no, no you have to take a shower, 'cause, eww. No, you know what you have to answer her, answer her first. No, no, you know what make some coffee 'cause its too much.","Okay, I'll do it!"
"Okay, one more, please. Come on, I'm gonna get it in this time, I will.",
"You know what, maybe I don't need to have children. You know maybe I just think I do because that is what society, and by that I mean my mom, has always convinced me that I... I do, I have to have children, I'm sorry, I just do.","Okay, last chance. Again, I'm sorry."
What?!,"Yo! Can I have your attention, please, Best Man, making a toast here. Thank you. I remember when Barry got home from his first date with Rachel..."
What.,"What, you hired the same band I can't use the same speech. Thank you, thank you very much. Anyway, I wish you both a wonderful life together. And Rachel..."
"Uh, I like to, uh, to add something to that...","No, no, no now in all seriousness, its not a lot of women would've had the guts to come back here tonight, and even fewer, who would do it with their asses hanging out!"
"Most of you don't know me, I'm Rachel's boyfriend.","Why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding?"
"Ross, uh and uh, I'd just like to say that it did take a lot of courage for Rachel to come here tonight. And, uh, for the record she did not run out on Barry because she had syphilis. What are you doing I'm serious. Uh, the reason she walked out on, on Barry is simply that she didn't love him, which incidentally worked out pretty well for me Cheers.",Oh dear God.
"No, Rach!",She you in the parking lot.
"Ya, know what Barr, I'm not gonna leave. I probably should, but I'm not, see 'cause I promised myself that I would make it through at least *one* of your weddings . See now, tonight, all I really wanted was to make it though this evening with a little bit of grace and dignity. Well , I guess we can all agree that's not gonna happen. There's nothing really left to say except.... ""Her name was Lola. She was a showgirl. With yellow feathers , feathers in her hair, and a dress cut down to there. She would...""",And once again she is out of here. Okay who had 9:45? Um?
"""...marenge, thank you honey, and do the cha-cha. And while she like to be a star, Tony always tended bar. At the, wait, wait, everybody..""","Marenge,"
"At the Copa, Copa Cabana The hottest spot north of Havana. At the Copa, Coo-pa Ca-ban-a, music and fashion were always the passion, at the Copa....",Everybody!
"Okay, I'll do it.",
If kids is what I takes to be with you then kids it is.,You'll do what?
"If I have to I'll, I'll do all again , I'll do the 4 o'clock feeding thing, I'll go to the P.T.A. meetings, I'll coach the soccer team.",Oh my God!
"Yeah, if I have to. Monica, I don't wanna lose you, so if I have to do it all over again, then I will.",Really?
But you're not.,"You're the most wonderful man. And if you hadn't of said 'if I have to' like seventeen times, then I'd be saying 'okay, let's do it.'"
God. I love you.,"Oh my God, I can't believe what I'm getting ready to say. I wanna have a baby, but I don't wanna have one with someone who doesn't really wanna have one."
I guess we just keep dancing.,I know you do. Me too. So what now?
"Where is she, Where is she? Oh, hey, I have a question, where is she?",
"Ooh, oh, oh, that's her.","Chandler, relax, Chandler, she'll be here."
"Chandler, you gotta stop staring at the door. It's like a watched pot, you know if you keep looking at it then the door is to, never gonna boil. I think what you have to do is try not to...","Yeah, 'cause life's just that kind."
OH.....MY.....GAWD!!,Oh my God!
,OH.....MY.....GOD!!
"Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get it. But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl.","All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna be a good friend, and dammit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes ."
